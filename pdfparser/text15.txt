For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.  
There is a tutorial that walks you through how to create the stl file once you are satisfied with 
your design.  
When you first create a document, there are three planes in the display window.  The planes are 
named Front, Top, and Right.  These correspond with the front, top, and right views in a 2D drawing.  
The planes are displayed as thin rectangles.  Planes are infinite, but there really isn’t a good way to display an infinite plane.  Think of the plane as a limitless piece of paper.
