In the browser, under Default geometry, the Origin and the three planes are listed.  
 
The origin is the 0,0,0 (x =0, y=0, z=0) point in the 3D universe where you are creating the 
design.  
The origin basically allows you to locate the geometry in relation to 3 -dimensional space.  If you 
donâ€™t provide a location for the lines, circles, and arcs, it could move around and the results 
would not be pretty.  
Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.
