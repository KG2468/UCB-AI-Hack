GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.
