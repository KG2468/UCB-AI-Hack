GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated
