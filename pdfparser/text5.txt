GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
4 8. You start in the Tutorials and Samples area.  
 
Onshape has two document states:  Public and Private.  If a document is public, anybody with an 
Onshape account can view and download the file.   If you a re the owner or creator of the 
document, you can share it with other users, but the users must have an Onshape account.   
Both public and private documents can be shared.  Sharing a document allows anyone who has 
been provided access to make modifications to the document.  More than one user can edit a 
shared document at a time, similarly to how Google Docs works.   
If you are not the owner/creator of a document, you cannot  share it.  I f you find a public model 
that you like, you can send the URL t o a friend, so they can see it .  Since neither you nor  your 
friend own the model, neither you nor  your friend w ill be able to modify the file.   Alternatively, 
you can make a copy of a public document and own the copy.  Once you own the copy, you can share it w ith anyone you like.  
You can transfer ownership of a document to another user. If you are finished working on a project, you can hand it off to another user and let them take over.
