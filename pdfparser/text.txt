1 Getting Started  
Explanation of how Onshape Works  
When I started working in CAD in 1982, the emerging software – the new kid on the block – was 
AutoCAD created by a company headquartered  in San Rafael, California named Autodesk.  The 
interface consisted of a screen menu.  You used a keyboard and short cut keys – like L for Line – 
to create your technical drawings, which consisted of lines, arcs, and circles.  There was no 
rendering.  Ther e were no layers.  There was no color.  You drew in white on a black 
background.  At the time, many drafters and designers said that CADD (Computer Aided 
Drafting/Design) software would never replace pencil and paper.  
So, here we are in 2016  and how the wo rld has changed.  Today most CADD software is moving 
to the cloud.  This means that users will download a small software program that allows them to log in to an account and save their work on remote servers.  So, users are no longer tied down to a worksta tion or an office.  You can access your work from any device anywhere in the world 
– as long as you have an internet connection.  
Onshape takes it one step beyond this.   
Firstly, Onshape is entire ly 100% cloud -based.  This means you don’t have to install a ny 
software.  You don’t have to get permission from your IT department to put the software on your workstation , and you don’t use up any space on your hard drive or jump drive or wherever 
you like to store files.  Everything happens on Onshape’ s servers.   
Because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, it is accessible from any device that uses a browser, 
like Firefox or Chrome.  This means that you can pull up Onshape with any internet connection on your tablet, smart phone, laptop, or work station.  Onshape even  offers apps for Android and 
iOS devices.  
Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.   
Onshape does use “cookies,”  so make sure you set your browser to accept cookies.  If th e 
browser interface is not working properly, perform a hard refresh. (H old down Command and 
Shift, then press R in any Apple or Mac operating system.  For a WINDOWS operating system, press Ctl+F5. )  GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

To get started, go to onshape.com.  
 
1. Select the Create Account link.  
 
2. Fill in the form with your name and email address.  
 
3. Select the market segment that applies to you.  I selected EDUCATION.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
3 4. Fill out the form appropriately with your information.  
 
5. Be sure to add alerts@onshape.com  to your contacts or “whitelist” or their email might 
end up in your junk folder.  If you can’t locate the confirmation email in your junk fold er 
or access it, use the Reset Password link to get a new email sent to you after you have 
added Onshape to your contacts list.  
 
6. Select the link  that is provided in the email . 
 
7. Set up a password for the account. Be sure to write it down somewhere! Press the Sign Up button and Onshape will immediately launch.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
4 8. You start in the Tutorials and Samples area.  
 
Onshape has two document states:  Public and Private.  If a document is public, anybody with an 
Onshape account can view and download the file.   If you a re the owner or creator of the 
document, you can share it with other users, but the users must have an Onshape account.   
Both public and private documents can be shared.  Sharing a document allows anyone who has 
been provided access to make modifications to the document.  More than one user can edit a 
shared document at a time, similarly to how Google Docs works.   
If you are not the owner/creator of a document, you cannot  share it.  I f you find a public model 
that you like, you can send the URL t o a friend, so they can see it .  Since neither you nor  your 
friend own the model, neither you nor  your friend w ill be able to modify the file.   Alternatively, 
you can make a copy of a public document and own the copy.  Once you own the copy, you can share it w ith anyone you like.  
You can transfer ownership of a document to another user. If you are finished working on a project, you can hand it off to another user and let them take over.

If you want to transfer ownership to another user, select Owner from the drop -down list.  Then 
left click on the Share button.   
For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.  
There is a tutorial that walks you through how to create the stl file once you are satisfied with 
your design.  
When you first create a document, there are three planes in the display window.  The planes are 
named Front, Top, and Right.  These correspond with the front, top, and right views in a 2D drawing.  
The planes are displayed as thin rectangles.  Planes are infinite, but there really isn’t a good way to display an infinite plane.  Think of the plane as a limitless piece of paper.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
15  
In the browser, under Default geometry, the Origin and the three planes are listed.  
 
The origin is the 0,0,0 (x =0, y=0, z=0) point in the 3D universe where you are creating the 
design.  
The origin basically allows you to locate the geometry in relation to 3 -dimensional space.  If you 
don’t provide a location for the lines, circles, and arcs, it could move around and the results 
would not be pretty.  
Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
16  
There are four primary feature types:  
• Extrude  
• Revolve  
• Sweep  
• Loft 
 
For an Extrude, you place a sketch and then add height or thickness.  Common objects 
that use extrudes are boxes.  
 
For a Revolve, you place a sketch and then revolve it around an axis.  An axis can be an edge or 
line.   
Common objects that use revolves are wheels and gears.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
17  
For a Sweep, you create two sketches.  One sketch is the profile and one sketch is the path.  The 
profile travels along the path to create the 3D shape. The two sketches are usually 
perpendicular to each other.  The path would be on one plane, and the profile would be on a 
different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

1 Getting Started  
Explanation of how Onshape Works  
When I started working in CAD in 1982, the emerging software – the new kid on the block – was 
AutoCAD created by a company headquartered  in San Rafael, California named Autodesk.  The 
interface consisted of a screen menu.  You used a keyboard and short cut keys – like L for Line – 
to create your technical drawings, which consisted of lines, arcs, and circles.  There was no 
rendering.  Ther e were no layers.  There was no color.  You drew in white on a black 
background.  At the time, many drafters and designers said that CADD (Computer Aided 
Drafting/Design) software would never replace pencil and paper.  
So, here we are in 2016  and how the wo rld has changed.  Today most CADD software is moving 
to the cloud.  This means that users will download a small software program that allows them to log in to an account and save their work on remote servers.  So, users are no longer tied down to a worksta tion or an office.  You can access your work from any device anywhere in the world 
– as long as you have an internet connection.  
Onshape takes it one step beyond this.   
Firstly, Onshape is entire ly 100% cloud -based.  This means you don’t have to install a ny 
software.  You don’t have to get permission from your IT department to put the software on your workstation , and you don’t use up any space on your hard drive or jump drive or wherever 
you like to store files.  Everything happens on Onshape’ s servers.   
Because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, it is accessible from any device that uses a browser, 
like Firefox or Chrome.  This means that you can pull up Onshape with any internet connection on your tablet, smart phone, laptop, or work station.  Onshape even  offers apps for Android and 
iOS devices.  
Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.   
Onshape does use “cookies,”  so make sure you set your browser to accept cookies.  If th e 
browser interface is not working properly, perform a hard refresh. (H old down Command and 
Shift, then press R in any Apple or Mac operating system.  For a WINDOWS operating system, press Ctl+F5. )  GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

4 8. You start in the Tutorials and Samples area.  
 
Onshape has two document states:  Public and Private.  If a document is public, anybody with an 
Onshape account can view and download the file.   If you a re the owner or creator of the 
document, you can share it with other users, but the users must have an Onshape account.   
Both public and private documents can be shared.  Sharing a document allows anyone who has 
been provided access to make modifications to the document.  More than one user can edit a 
shared document at a time, similarly to how Google Docs works.   
If you are not the owner/creator of a document, you cannot  share it.  I f you find a public model 
that you like, you can send the URL t o a friend, so they can see it .  Since neither you nor  your 
friend own the model, neither you nor  your friend w ill be able to modify the file.   Alternatively, 
you can make a copy of a public document and own the copy.  Once you own the copy, you can share it w ith anyone you like.  
You can transfer ownership of a document to another user. If you are finished working on a project, you can hand it off to another user and let them take over.

If you want to transfer ownership to another user, select Owner from the drop -down list.  Then 
left click on the Share button.   
For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.  
There is a tutorial that walks you through how to create the stl file once you are satisfied with 
your design.  
When you first create a document, there are three planes in the display window.  The planes are 
named Front, Top, and Right.  These correspond with the front, top, and right views in a 2D drawing.  
The planes are displayed as thin rectangles.  Planes are infinite, but there really isn’t a good way to display an infinite plane.  Think of the plane as a limitless piece of paper.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
15  
In the browser, under Default geometry, the Origin and the three planes are listed.  
 
The origin is the 0,0,0 (x =0, y=0, z=0) point in the 3D universe where you are creating the 
design.  
The origin basically allows you to locate the geometry in relation to 3 -dimensional space.  If you 
don’t provide a location for the lines, circles, and arcs, it could move around and the results 
would not be pretty.  
Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
16  
There are four primary feature types:  
• Extrude  
• Revolve  
• Sweep  
• Loft 
 
For an Extrude, you place a sketch and then add height or thickness.  Common objects 
that use extrudes are boxes.  
 
For a Revolve, you place a sketch and then revolve it around an axis.  An axis can be an edge or 
line.   
Common objects that use revolves are wheels and gears.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
17  
For a Sweep, you create two sketches.  One sketch is the profile and one sketch is the path.  The 
profile travels along the path to create the 3D shape. The two sketches are usually 
perpendicular to each other.  The path would be on one plane, and the profile would be on a 
different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.  
There is a tutorial that walks you through how to create the stl file once you are satisfied with 
your design.  
When you first create a document, there are three planes in the display window.  The planes are 
named Front, Top, and Right.  These correspond with the front, top, and right views in a 2D drawing.  
The planes are displayed as thin rectangles.  Planes are infinite, but there really isn’t a good way to display an infinite plane.  Think of the plane as a limitless piece of paper.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
15  
In the browser, under Default geometry, the Origin and the three planes are listed.  
 
The origin is the 0,0,0 (x =0, y=0, z=0) point in the 3D universe where you are creating the 
design.  
The origin basically allows you to locate the geometry in relation to 3 -dimensional space.  If you 
don’t provide a location for the lines, circles, and arcs, it could move around and the results 
would not be pretty.  
Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
16  
There are four primary feature types:  
• Extrude  
• Revolve  
• Sweep  
• Loft 
 
For an Extrude, you place a sketch and then add height or thickness.  Common objects 
that use extrudes are boxes.  
 
For a Revolve, you place a sketch and then revolve it around an axis.  An axis can be an edge or 
line.   
Common objects that use revolves are wheels and gears.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
17  
For a Sweep, you create two sketches.  One sketch is the profile and one sketch is the path.  The 
profile travels along the path to create the 3D shape. The two sketches are usually 
perpendicular to each other.  The path would be on one plane, and the profile would be on a 
different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

1 Getting Started  
Explanation of how Onshape Works  
When I started working in CAD in 1982, the emerging software – the new kid on the block – was 
AutoCAD created by a company headquartered  in San Rafael, California named Autodesk.  The 
interface consisted of a screen menu.  You used a keyboard and short cut keys – like L for Line – 
to create your technical drawings, which consisted of lines, arcs, and circles.  There was no 
rendering.  Ther e were no layers.  There was no color.  You drew in white on a black 
background.  At the time, many drafters and designers said that CADD (Computer Aided 
Drafting/Design) software would never replace pencil and paper.  
So, here we are in 2016  and how the wo rld has changed.  Today most CADD software is moving 
to the cloud.  This means that users will download a small software program that allows them to log in to an account and save their work on remote servers.  So, users are no longer tied down to a worksta tion or an office.  You can access your work from any device anywhere in the world 
– as long as you have an internet connection.  
Onshape takes it one step beyond this.   
Firstly, Onshape is entire ly 100% cloud -based.  This means you don’t have to install a ny 
software.  You don’t have to get permission from your IT department to put the software on your workstation , and you don’t use up any space on your hard drive or jump drive or wherever 
you like to store files.  Everything happens on Onshape’ s servers.   
Because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, it is accessible from any device that uses a browser, 
like Firefox or Chrome.  This means that you can pull up Onshape with any internet connection on your tablet, smart phone, laptop, or work station.  Onshape even  offers apps for Android and 
iOS devices.  
Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.   
Onshape does use “cookies,”  so make sure you set your browser to accept cookies.  If th e 
browser interface is not working properly, perform a hard refresh. (H old down Command and 
Shift, then press R in any Apple or Mac operating system.  For a WINDOWS operating system, press Ctl+F5. )  GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

4 8. You start in the Tutorials and Samples area.  
 
Onshape has two document states:  Public and Private.  If a document is public, anybody with an 
Onshape account can view and download the file.   If you a re the owner or creator of the 
document, you can share it with other users, but the users must have an Onshape account.   
Both public and private documents can be shared.  Sharing a document allows anyone who has 
been provided access to make modifications to the document.  More than one user can edit a 
shared document at a time, similarly to how Google Docs works.   
If you are not the owner/creator of a document, you cannot  share it.  I f you find a public model 
that you like, you can send the URL t o a friend, so they can see it .  Since neither you nor  your 
friend own the model, neither you nor  your friend w ill be able to modify the file.   Alternatively, 
you can make a copy of a public document and own the copy.  Once you own the copy, you can share it w ith anyone you like.  
You can transfer ownership of a document to another user. If you are finished working on a project, you can hand it off to another user and let them take over.

For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.

For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.  
There is a tutorial that walks you through how to create the stl file once you are satisfied with 
your design.  
When you first create a document, there are three planes in the display window.  The planes are 
named Front, Top, and Right.  These correspond with the front, top, and right views in a 2D drawing.  
The planes are displayed as thin rectangles.  Planes are infinite, but there really isn’t a good way to display an infinite plane.  Think of the plane as a limitless piece of paper.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
15  
In the browser, under Default geometry, the Origin and the three planes are listed.  
 
The origin is the 0,0,0 (x =0, y=0, z=0) point in the 3D universe where you are creating the 
design.  
The origin basically allows you to locate the geometry in relation to 3 -dimensional space.  If you 
don’t provide a location for the lines, circles, and arcs, it could move around and the results 
would not be pretty.  
Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
16  
There are four primary feature types:  
• Extrude  
• Revolve  
• Sweep  
• Loft 
 
For an Extrude, you place a sketch and then add height or thickness.  Common objects 
that use extrudes are boxes.  
 
For a Revolve, you place a sketch and then revolve it around an axis.  An axis can be an edge or 
line.   
Common objects that use revolves are wheels and gears.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
17  
For a Sweep, you create two sketches.  One sketch is the profile and one sketch is the path.  The 
profile travels along the path to create the 3D shape. The two sketches are usually 
perpendicular to each other.  The path would be on one plane, and the profile would be on a 
different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

1 Getting Started  
Explanation of how Onshape Works  
When I started working in CAD in 1982, the emerging software – the new kid on the block – was 
AutoCAD created by a company headquartered  in San Rafael, California named Autodesk.  The 
interface consisted of a screen menu.  You used a keyboard and short cut keys – like L for Line – 
to create your technical drawings, which consisted of lines, arcs, and circles.  There was no 
rendering.  Ther e were no layers.  There was no color.  You drew in white on a black 
background.  At the time, many drafters and designers said that CADD (Computer Aided 
Drafting/Design) software would never replace pencil and paper.  
So, here we are in 2016  and how the wo rld has changed.  Today most CADD software is moving 
to the cloud.  This means that users will download a small software program that allows them to log in to an account and save their work on remote servers.  So, users are no longer tied down to a worksta tion or an office.  You can access your work from any device anywhere in the world 
– as long as you have an internet connection.  
Onshape takes it one step beyond this.   
Firstly, Onshape is entire ly 100% cloud -based.  This means you don’t have to install a ny 
software.  You don’t have to get permission from your IT department to put the software on your workstation , and you don’t use up any space on your hard drive or jump drive or wherever 
you like to store files.  Everything happens on Onshape’ s servers.   
Because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, it is accessible from any device that uses a browser, 
like Firefox or Chrome.  This means that you can pull up Onshape with any internet connection on your tablet, smart phone, laptop, or work station.  Onshape even  offers apps for Android and 
iOS devices.  
Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.   
Onshape does use “cookies,”  so make sure you set your browser to accept cookies.  If th e 
browser interface is not working properly, perform a hard refresh. (H old down Command and 
Shift, then press R in any Apple or Mac operating system.  For a WINDOWS operating system, press Ctl+F5. )  GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

Onshape has two document states:  Public and Private.  If a document is public, anybody with an 
Onshape account can view and download the file.   If you a re the owner or creator of the 
document, you can share it with other users, but the users must have an Onshape account.   
Both public and private documents can be shared.  Sharing a document allows anyone who has 
been provided access to make modifications to the document.  More than one user can edit a 
shared document at a time, similarly to how Google Docs works.   
If you are not the owner/creator of a document, you cannot  share it.  I f you find a public model 
that you like, you can send the URL t o a friend, so they can see it .  Since neither you nor  your 
friend own the model, neither you nor  your friend w ill be able to modify the file.   Alternatively, 
you can make a copy of a public document and own the copy.  Once you own the copy, you can share it w ith anyone you like.  
You can transfer ownership of a document to another user. If you are finished working on a project, you can hand it off to another user and let them take over.

If you want to transfer ownership to another user, select Owner from the drop -down list.  Then 
left click on the Share button.   
For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.  
There is a tutorial that walks you through how to create the stl file once you are satisfied with 
your design.  
When you first create a document, there are three planes in the display window.  The planes are 
named Front, Top, and Right.  These correspond with the front, top, and right views in a 2D drawing.  
The planes are displayed as thin rectangles.  Planes are infinite, but there really isn’t a good way to display an infinite plane.  Think of the plane as a limitless piece of paper.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
15  
In the browser, under Default geometry, the Origin and the three planes are listed.  
 
The origin is the 0,0,0 (x =0, y=0, z=0) point in the 3D universe where you are creating the 
design.  
The origin basically allows you to locate the geometry in relation to 3 -dimensional space.  If you 
don’t provide a location for the lines, circles, and arcs, it could move around and the results 
would not be pretty.  
Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
16  
There are four primary feature types:  
• Extrude  
• Revolve  
• Sweep  
• Loft 
 
For an Extrude, you place a sketch and then add height or thickness.  Common objects 
that use extrudes are boxes.  
 
For a Revolve, you place a sketch and then revolve it around an axis.  An axis can be an edge or 
line.   
Common objects that use revolves are wheels and gears.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
17  
For a Sweep, you create two sketches.  One sketch is the profile and one sketch is the path.  The 
profile travels along the path to create the 3D shape. The two sketches are usually 
perpendicular to each other.  The path would be on one plane, and the profile would be on a 
different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

1 Getting Started  
Explanation of how Onshape Works  
When I started working in CAD in 1982, the emerging software – the new kid on the block – was 
AutoCAD created by a company headquartered  in San Rafael, California named Autodesk.  The 
interface consisted of a screen menu.  You used a keyboard and short cut keys – like L for Line – 
to create your technical drawings, which consisted of lines, arcs, and circles.  There was no 
rendering.  Ther e were no layers.  There was no color.  You drew in white on a black 
background.  At the time, many drafters and designers said that CADD (Computer Aided 
Drafting/Design) software would never replace pencil and paper.  
So, here we are in 2016  and how the wo rld has changed.  Today most CADD software is moving 
to the cloud.  This means that users will download a small software program that allows them to log in to an account and save their work on remote servers.  So, users are no longer tied down to a worksta tion or an office.  You can access your work from any device anywhere in the world 
– as long as you have an internet connection.  
Onshape takes it one step beyond this.   
Firstly, Onshape is entire ly 100% cloud -based.  This means you don’t have to install a ny 
software.  You don’t have to get permission from your IT department to put the software on your workstation , and you don’t use up any space on your hard drive or jump drive or wherever 
you like to store files.  Everything happens on Onshape’ s servers.   
Because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, it is accessible from any device that uses a browser, 
like Firefox or Chrome.  This means that you can pull up Onshape with any internet connection on your tablet, smart phone, laptop, or work station.  Onshape even  offers apps for Android and 
iOS devices.  
Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.   
Onshape does use “cookies,”  so make sure you set your browser to accept cookies.  If th e 
browser interface is not working properly, perform a hard refresh. (H old down Command and 
Shift, then press R in any Apple or Mac operating system.  For a WINDOWS operating system, press Ctl+F5. )  GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

4 8. You start in the Tutorials and Samples area.  
 
Onshape has two document states:  Public and Private.  If a document is public, anybody with an 
Onshape account can view and download the file.   If you a re the owner or creator of the 
document, you can share it with other users, but the users must have an Onshape account.   
Both public and private documents can be shared.  Sharing a document allows anyone who has 
been provided access to make modifications to the document.  More than one user can edit a 
shared document at a time, similarly to how Google Docs works.   
If you are not the owner/creator of a document, you cannot  share it.  I f you find a public model 
that you like, you can send the URL t o a friend, so they can see it .  Since neither you nor  your 
friend own the model, neither you nor  your friend w ill be able to modify the file.   Alternatively, 
you can make a copy of a public document and own the copy.  Once you own the copy, you can share it w ith anyone you like.  
You can transfer ownership of a document to another user. If you are finished working on a project, you can hand it off to another user and let them take over.

Onshape has two document states:  Public and Private.  If a document is public, anybody with an 
Onshape account can view and download the file.   If you a re the owner or creator of the 
document, you can share it with other users, but the users must have an Onshape account.   
Both public and private documents can be shared.  Sharing a document allows anyone who has 
been provided access to make modifications to the document.  More than one user can edit a 
shared document at a time, similarly to how Google Docs works.   
If you are not the owner/creator of a document, you cannot  share it.  I f you find a public model 
that you like, you can send the URL t o a friend, so they can see it .  Since neither you nor  your 
friend own the model, neither you nor  your friend w ill be able to modify the file.   Alternatively, 
you can make a copy of a public document and own the copy.  Once you own the copy, you can share it w ith anyone you like.  
You can transfer ownership of a document to another user. If you are finished working on a project, you can hand it off to another user and let them take over.

For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.  
There is a tutorial that walks you through how to create the stl file once you are satisfied with 
your design.  
When you first create a document, there are three planes in the display window.  The planes are 
named Front, Top, and Right.  These correspond with the front, top, and right views in a 2D drawing.  
The planes are displayed as thin rectangles.  Planes are infinite, but there really isn’t a good way to display an infinite plane.  Think of the plane as a limitless piece of paper.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
15  
In the browser, under Default geometry, the Origin and the three planes are listed.  
 
The origin is the 0,0,0 (x =0, y=0, z=0) point in the 3D universe where you are creating the 
design.  
The origin basically allows you to locate the geometry in relation to 3 -dimensional space.  If you 
don’t provide a location for the lines, circles, and arcs, it could move around and the results 
would not be pretty.  
Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
16  
There are four primary feature types:  
• Extrude  
• Revolve  
• Sweep  
• Loft 
 
For an Extrude, you place a sketch and then add height or thickness.  Common objects 
that use extrudes are boxes.  
 
For a Revolve, you place a sketch and then revolve it around an axis.  An axis can be an edge or 
line.   
Common objects that use revolves are wheels and gears.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
17  
For a Sweep, you create two sketches.  One sketch is the profile and one sketch is the path.  The 
profile travels along the path to create the 3D shape. The two sketches are usually 
perpendicular to each other.  The path would be on one plane, and the profile would be on a 
different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

1 Getting Started  
Explanation of how Onshape Works  
When I started working in CAD in 1982, the emerging software – the new kid on the block – was 
AutoCAD created by a company headquartered  in San Rafael, California named Autodesk.  The 
interface consisted of a screen menu.  You used a keyboard and short cut keys – like L for Line – 
to create your technical drawings, which consisted of lines, arcs, and circles.  There was no 
rendering.  Ther e were no layers.  There was no color.  You drew in white on a black 
background.  At the time, many drafters and designers said that CADD (Computer Aided 
Drafting/Design) software would never replace pencil and paper.  
So, here we are in 2016  and how the wo rld has changed.  Today most CADD software is moving 
to the cloud.  This means that users will download a small software program that allows them to log in to an account and save their work on remote servers.  So, users are no longer tied down to a worksta tion or an office.  You can access your work from any device anywhere in the world 
– as long as you have an internet connection.  
Onshape takes it one step beyond this.   
Firstly, Onshape is entire ly 100% cloud -based.  This means you don’t have to install a ny 
software.  You don’t have to get permission from your IT department to put the software on your workstation , and you don’t use up any space on your hard drive or jump drive or wherever 
you like to store files.  Everything happens on Onshape’ s servers.   
Because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, it is accessible from any device that uses a browser, 
like Firefox or Chrome.  This means that you can pull up Onshape with any internet connection on your tablet, smart phone, laptop, or work station.  Onshape even  offers apps for Android and 
iOS devices.  
Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.   
Onshape does use “cookies,”  so make sure you set your browser to accept cookies.  If th e 
browser interface is not working properly, perform a hard refresh. (H old down Command and 
Shift, then press R in any Apple or Mac operating system.  For a WINDOWS operating system, press Ctl+F5. )  GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

So, here we are in 2016  and how the wo rld has changed.  Today most CADD software is moving 
to the cloud.  This means that users will download a small software program that allows them to log in to an account and save their work on remote servers.  So, users are no longer tied down to a worksta tion or an office.  You can access your work from any device anywhere in the world 
– as long as you have an internet connection.  
Onshape takes it one step beyond this.   
Firstly, Onshape is entire ly 100% cloud -based.  This means you don’t have to install a ny 
software.  You don’t have to get permission from your IT department to put the software on your workstation , and you don’t use up any space on your hard drive or jump drive or wherever 
you like to store files.  Everything happens on Onshape’ s servers.   
Because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, it is accessible from any device that uses a browser, 
like Firefox or Chrome.  This means that you can pull up Onshape with any internet connection on your tablet, smart phone, laptop, or work station.  Onshape even  offers apps for Android and 
iOS devices.  
Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.   
Onshape does use “cookies,”  so make sure you set your browser to accept cookies.  If th e 
browser interface is not working properly, perform a hard refresh. (H old down Command and 
Shift, then press R in any Apple or Mac operating system.  For a WINDOWS operating system, press Ctl+F5. )  GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

Onshape has two document states:  Public and Private.  If a document is public, anybody with an 
Onshape account can view and download the file.   If you a re the owner or creator of the 
document, you can share it with other users, but the users must have an Onshape account.   
Both public and private documents can be shared.  Sharing a document allows anyone who has 
been provided access to make modifications to the document.  More than one user can edit a 
shared document at a time, similarly to how Google Docs works.   
If you are not the owner/creator of a document, you cannot  share it.  I f you find a public model 
that you like, you can send the URL t o a friend, so they can see it .  Since neither you nor  your 
friend own the model, neither you nor  your friend w ill be able to modify the file.   Alternatively, 
you can make a copy of a public document and own the copy.  Once you own the copy, you can share it w ith anyone you like.  
You can transfer ownership of a document to another user. If you are finished working on a project, you can hand it off to another user and let them take over.

For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.  
There is a tutorial that walks you through how to create the stl file once you are satisfied with 
your design.  
When you first create a document, there are three planes in the display window.  The planes are 
named Front, Top, and Right.  These correspond with the front, top, and right views in a 2D drawing.  
The planes are displayed as thin rectangles.  Planes are infinite, but there really isn’t a good way to display an infinite plane.  Think of the plane as a limitless piece of paper.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
15  
In the browser, under Default geometry, the Origin and the three planes are listed.  
 
The origin is the 0,0,0 (x =0, y=0, z=0) point in the 3D universe where you are creating the 
design.  
The origin basically allows you to locate the geometry in relation to 3 -dimensional space.  If you 
don’t provide a location for the lines, circles, and arcs, it could move around and the results 
would not be pretty.  
Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
16  
There are four primary feature types:  
• Extrude  
• Revolve  
• Sweep  
• Loft 
 
For an Extrude, you place a sketch and then add height or thickness.  Common objects 
that use extrudes are boxes.  
 
For a Revolve, you place a sketch and then revolve it around an axis.  An axis can be an edge or 
line.   
Common objects that use revolves are wheels and gears.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
17  
For a Sweep, you create two sketches.  One sketch is the profile and one sketch is the path.  The 
profile travels along the path to create the 3D shape. The two sketches are usually 
perpendicular to each other.  The path would be on one plane, and the profile would be on a 
different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

1 Getting Started  
Explanation of how Onshape Works  
When I started working in CAD in 1982, the emerging software – the new kid on the block – was 
AutoCAD created by a company headquartered  in San Rafael, California named Autodesk.  The 
interface consisted of a screen menu.  You used a keyboard and short cut keys – like L for Line – 
to create your technical drawings, which consisted of lines, arcs, and circles.  There was no 
rendering.  Ther e were no layers.  There was no color.  You drew in white on a black 
background.  At the time, many drafters and designers said that CADD (Computer Aided 
Drafting/Design) software would never replace pencil and paper.  
So, here we are in 2016  and how the wo rld has changed.  Today most CADD software is moving 
to the cloud.  This means that users will download a small software program that allows them to log in to an account and save their work on remote servers.  So, users are no longer tied down to a worksta tion or an office.  You can access your work from any device anywhere in the world 
– as long as you have an internet connection.  
Onshape takes it one step beyond this.   
Firstly, Onshape is entire ly 100% cloud -based.  This means you don’t have to install a ny 
software.  You don’t have to get permission from your IT department to put the software on your workstation , and you don’t use up any space on your hard drive or jump drive or wherever 
you like to store files.  Everything happens on Onshape’ s servers.   
Because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, it is accessible from any device that uses a browser, 
like Firefox or Chrome.  This means that you can pull up Onshape with any internet connection on your tablet, smart phone, laptop, or work station.  Onshape even  offers apps for Android and 
iOS devices.  
Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.

For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.

element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

1 Getting Started  
Explanation of how Onshape Works  
When I started working in CAD in 1982, the emerging software – the new kid on the block – was 
AutoCAD created by a company headquartered  in San Rafael, California named Autodesk.  The 
interface consisted of a screen menu.  You used a keyboard and short cut keys – like L for Line – 
to create your technical drawings, which consisted of lines, arcs, and circles.  There was no 
rendering.  Ther e were no layers.  There was no color.  You drew in white on a black 
background.  At the time, many drafters and designers said that CADD (Computer Aided 
Drafting/Design) software would never replace pencil and paper.  
So, here we are in 2016  and how the wo rld has changed.  Today most CADD software is moving 
to the cloud.  This means that users will download a small software program that allows them to log in to an account and save their work on remote servers.  So, users are no longer tied down to a worksta tion or an office.  You can access your work from any device anywhere in the world 
– as long as you have an internet connection.  
Onshape takes it one step beyond this.   
Firstly, Onshape is entire ly 100% cloud -based.  This means you don’t have to install a ny 
software.  You don’t have to get permission from your IT department to put the software on your workstation , and you don’t use up any space on your hard drive or jump drive or wherever 
you like to store files.  Everything happens on Onshape’ s servers.   
Because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, it is accessible from any device that uses a browser, 
like Firefox or Chrome.  This means that you can pull up Onshape with any internet connection on your tablet, smart phone, laptop, or work station.  Onshape even  offers apps for Android and 
iOS devices.  
Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.   
Onshape does use “cookies,”  so make sure you set your browser to accept cookies.  If th e 
browser interface is not working properly, perform a hard refresh. (H old down Command and 
Shift, then press R in any Apple or Mac operating system.  For a WINDOWS operating system, press Ctl+F5. )  GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

4 8. You start in the Tutorials and Samples area.  
 
Onshape has two document states:  Public and Private.  If a document is public, anybody with an 
Onshape account can view and download the file.   If you a re the owner or creator of the 
document, you can share it with other users, but the users must have an Onshape account.   
Both public and private documents can be shared.  Sharing a document allows anyone who has 
been provided access to make modifications to the document.  More than one user can edit a 
shared document at a time, similarly to how Google Docs works.   
If you are not the owner/creator of a document, you cannot  share it.  I f you find a public model 
that you like, you can send the URL t o a friend, so they can see it .  Since neither you nor  your 
friend own the model, neither you nor  your friend w ill be able to modify the file.   Alternatively, 
you can make a copy of a public document and own the copy.  Once you own the copy, you can share it w ith anyone you like.  
You can transfer ownership of a document to another user. If you are finished working on a project, you can hand it off to another user and let them take over.

If you want to transfer ownership to another user, select Owner from the drop -down list.  Then 
left click on the Share button.   
For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.  
There is a tutorial that walks you through how to create the stl file once you are satisfied with 
your design.  
When you first create a document, there are three planes in the display window.  The planes are 
named Front, Top, and Right.  These correspond with the front, top, and right views in a 2D drawing.  
The planes are displayed as thin rectangles.  Planes are infinite, but there really isn’t a good way to display an infinite plane.  Think of the plane as a limitless piece of paper.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
15  
In the browser, under Default geometry, the Origin and the three planes are listed.  
 
The origin is the 0,0,0 (x =0, y=0, z=0) point in the 3D universe where you are creating the 
design.  
The origin basically allows you to locate the geometry in relation to 3 -dimensional space.  If you 
don’t provide a location for the lines, circles, and arcs, it could move around and the results 
would not be pretty.  
Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
16  
There are four primary feature types:  
• Extrude  
• Revolve  
• Sweep  
• Loft 
 
For an Extrude, you place a sketch and then add height or thickness.  Common objects 
that use extrudes are boxes.  
 
For a Revolve, you place a sketch and then revolve it around an axis.  An axis can be an edge or 
line.   
Common objects that use revolves are wheels and gears.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
17  
For a Sweep, you create two sketches.  One sketch is the profile and one sketch is the path.  The 
profile travels along the path to create the 3D shape. The two sketches are usually 
perpendicular to each other.  The path would be on one plane, and the profile would be on a 
different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

There are four primary feature types:  
• Extrude  
• Revolve  
• Sweep  
• Loft 
 
For an Extrude, you place a sketch and then add height or thickness.  Common objects 
that use extrudes are boxes.  
 
For a Revolve, you place a sketch and then revolve it around an axis.  An axis can be an edge or 
line.   
Common objects that use revolves are wheels and gears.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
17  
For a Sweep, you create two sketches.  One sketch is the profile and one sketch is the path.  The 
profile travels along the path to create the 3D shape. The two sketches are usually 
perpendicular to each other.  The path would be on one plane, and the profile would be on a 
different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

1 Getting Started  
Explanation of how Onshape Works  
When I started working in CAD in 1982, the emerging software – the new kid on the block – was 
AutoCAD created by a company headquartered  in San Rafael, California named Autodesk.  The 
interface consisted of a screen menu.  You used a keyboard and short cut keys – like L for Line – 
to create your technical drawings, which consisted of lines, arcs, and circles.  There was no 
rendering.  Ther e were no layers.  There was no color.  You drew in white on a black 
background.  At the time, many drafters and designers said that CADD (Computer Aided 
Drafting/Design) software would never replace pencil and paper.  
So, here we are in 2016  and how the wo rld has changed.  Today most CADD software is moving 
to the cloud.  This means that users will download a small software program that allows them to log in to an account and save their work on remote servers.  So, users are no longer tied down to a worksta tion or an office.  You can access your work from any device anywhere in the world 
– as long as you have an internet connection.  
Onshape takes it one step beyond this.   
Firstly, Onshape is entire ly 100% cloud -based.  This means you don’t have to install a ny 
software.  You don’t have to get permission from your IT department to put the software on your workstation , and you don’t use up any space on your hard drive or jump drive or wherever 
you like to store files.  Everything happens on Onshape’ s servers.   
Because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, it is accessible from any device that uses a browser, 
like Firefox or Chrome.  This means that you can pull up Onshape with any internet connection on your tablet, smart phone, laptop, or work station.  Onshape even  offers apps for Android and 
iOS devices.  
Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.   
Onshape does use “cookies,”  so make sure you set your browser to accept cookies.  If th e 
browser interface is not working properly, perform a hard refresh. (H old down Command and 
Shift, then press R in any Apple or Mac operating system.  For a WINDOWS operating system, press Ctl+F5. )  GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

4 8. You start in the Tutorials and Samples area.  
 
Onshape has two document states:  Public and Private.  If a document is public, anybody with an 
Onshape account can view and download the file.   If you a re the owner or creator of the 
document, you can share it with other users, but the users must have an Onshape account.   
Both public and private documents can be shared.  Sharing a document allows anyone who has 
been provided access to make modifications to the document.  More than one user can edit a 
shared document at a time, similarly to how Google Docs works.   
If you are not the owner/creator of a document, you cannot  share it.  I f you find a public model 
that you like, you can send the URL t o a friend, so they can see it .  Since neither you nor  your 
friend own the model, neither you nor  your friend w ill be able to modify the file.   Alternatively, 
you can make a copy of a public document and own the copy.  Once you own the copy, you can share it w ith anyone you like.  
You can transfer ownership of a document to another user. If you are finished working on a project, you can hand it off to another user and let them take over.

If you want to transfer ownership to another user, select Owner from the drop -down list.  Then 
left click on the Share button.   
For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.  
There is a tutorial that walks you through how to create the stl file once you are satisfied with 
your design.  
When you first create a document, there are three planes in the display window.  The planes are 
named Front, Top, and Right.  These correspond with the front, top, and right views in a 2D drawing.  
The planes are displayed as thin rectangles.  Planes are infinite, but there really isn’t a good way to display an infinite plane.  Think of the plane as a limitless piece of paper.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
15  
In the browser, under Default geometry, the Origin and the three planes are listed.  
 
The origin is the 0,0,0 (x =0, y=0, z=0) point in the 3D universe where you are creating the 
design.  
The origin basically allows you to locate the geometry in relation to 3 -dimensional space.  If you 
don’t provide a location for the lines, circles, and arcs, it could move around and the results 
would not be pretty.  
Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.

There are four primary feature types:  
• Extrude

perpendicular to each other.  The path would be on one plane, and the profile would be on a 
different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.

For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.  
There is a tutorial that walks you through how to create the stl file once you are satisfied with 
your design.  
When you first create a document, there are three planes in the display window.  The planes are 
named Front, Top, and Right.  These correspond with the front, top, and right views in a 2D drawing.  
The planes are displayed as thin rectangles.  Planes are infinite, but there really isn’t a good way to display an infinite plane.  Think of the plane as a limitless piece of paper.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
15  
In the browser, under Default geometry, the Origin and the three planes are listed.  
 
The origin is the 0,0,0 (x =0, y=0, z=0) point in the 3D universe where you are creating the 
design.  
The origin basically allows you to locate the geometry in relation to 3 -dimensional space.  If you 
don’t provide a location for the lines, circles, and arcs, it could move around and the results 
would not be pretty.  
Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
16  
There are four primary feature types:  
• Extrude  
• Revolve  
• Sweep  
• Loft 
 
For an Extrude, you place a sketch and then add height or thickness.  Common objects 
that use extrudes are boxes.  
 
For a Revolve, you place a sketch and then revolve it around an axis.  An axis can be an edge or 
line.   
Common objects that use revolves are wheels and gears.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
17  
For a Sweep, you create two sketches.  One sketch is the profile and one sketch is the path.  The 
profile travels along the path to create the 3D shape. The two sketches are usually 
perpendicular to each other.  The path would be on one plane, and the profile would be on a 
different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

1 Getting Started  
Explanation of how Onshape Works  
When I started working in CAD in 1982, the emerging software – the new kid on the block – was 
AutoCAD created by a company headquartered  in San Rafael, California named Autodesk.  The 
interface consisted of a screen menu.  You used a keyboard and short cut keys – like L for Line – 
to create your technical drawings, which consisted of lines, arcs, and circles.  There was no 
rendering.  Ther e were no layers.  There was no color.  You drew in white on a black 
background.  At the time, many drafters and designers said that CADD (Computer Aided 
Drafting/Design) software would never replace pencil and paper.  
So, here we are in 2016  and how the wo rld has changed.  Today most CADD software is moving 
to the cloud.  This means that users will download a small software program that allows them to log in to an account and save their work on remote servers.  So, users are no longer tied down to a worksta tion or an office.  You can access your work from any device anywhere in the world 
– as long as you have an internet connection.  
Onshape takes it one step beyond this.   
Firstly, Onshape is entire ly 100% cloud -based.  This means you don’t have to install a ny 
software.  You don’t have to get permission from your IT department to put the software on your workstation , and you don’t use up any space on your hard drive or jump drive or wherever 
you like to store files.  Everything happens on Onshape’ s servers.   
Because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, it is accessible from any device that uses a browser, 
like Firefox or Chrome.  This means that you can pull up Onshape with any internet connection on your tablet, smart phone, laptop, or work station.  Onshape even  offers apps for Android and 
iOS devices.  
Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.   
Onshape does use “cookies,”  so make sure you set your browser to accept cookies.  If th e 
browser interface is not working properly, perform a hard refresh. (H old down Command and 
Shift, then press R in any Apple or Mac operating system.  For a WINDOWS operating system, press Ctl+F5. )  GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

4 8. You start in the Tutorials and Samples area.  
 
Onshape has two document states:  Public and Private.  If a document is public, anybody with an 
Onshape account can view and download the file.   If you a re the owner or creator of the 
document, you can share it with other users, but the users must have an Onshape account.   
Both public and private documents can be shared.  Sharing a document allows anyone who has 
been provided access to make modifications to the document.  More than one user can edit a 
shared document at a time, similarly to how Google Docs works.   
If you are not the owner/creator of a document, you cannot  share it.  I f you find a public model 
that you like, you can send the URL t o a friend, so they can see it .  Since neither you nor  your 
friend own the model, neither you nor  your friend w ill be able to modify the file.   Alternatively, 
you can make a copy of a public document and own the copy.  Once you own the copy, you can share it w ith anyone you like.  
You can transfer ownership of a document to another user. If you are finished working on a project, you can hand it off to another user and let them take over.

If you want to transfer ownership to another user, select Owner from the drop -down list.  Then 
left click on the Share button.   
For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.  
There is a tutorial that walks you through how to create the stl file once you are satisfied with 
your design.  
When you first create a document, there are three planes in the display window.  The planes are 
named Front, Top, and Right.  These correspond with the front, top, and right views in a 2D drawing.  
The planes are displayed as thin rectangles.  Planes are infinite, but there really isn’t a good way to display an infinite plane.  Think of the plane as a limitless piece of paper.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
15  
In the browser, under Default geometry, the Origin and the three planes are listed.  
 
The origin is the 0,0,0 (x =0, y=0, z=0) point in the 3D universe where you are creating the 
design.  
The origin basically allows you to locate the geometry in relation to 3 -dimensional space.  If you 
don’t provide a location for the lines, circles, and arcs, it could move around and the results 
would not be pretty.  
Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
16  
There are four primary feature types:  
• Extrude  
• Revolve  
• Sweep  
• Loft 
 
For an Extrude, you place a sketch and then add height or thickness.  Common objects 
that use extrudes are boxes.  
 
For a Revolve, you place a sketch and then revolve it around an axis.  An axis can be an edge or 
line.   
Common objects that use revolves are wheels and gears.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
17  
For a Sweep, you create two sketches.  One sketch is the profile and one sketch is the path.  The 
profile travels along the path to create the 3D shape. The two sketches are usually 
perpendicular to each other.  The path would be on one plane, and the profile would be on a 
different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

1 Getting Started  
Explanation of how Onshape Works  
When I started working in CAD in 1982, the emerging software – the new kid on the block – was 
AutoCAD created by a company headquartered  in San Rafael, California named Autodesk.  The 
interface consisted of a screen menu.  You used a keyboard and short cut keys – like L for Line – 
to create your technical drawings, which consisted of lines, arcs, and circles.  There was no 
rendering.  Ther e were no layers.  There was no color.  You drew in white on a black 
background.  At the time, many drafters and designers said that CADD (Computer Aided 
Drafting/Design) software would never replace pencil and paper.  
So, here we are in 2016  and how the wo rld has changed.  Today most CADD software is moving 
to the cloud.  This means that users will download a small software program that allows them to log in to an account and save their work on remote servers.  So, users are no longer tied down to a worksta tion or an office.  You can access your work from any device anywhere in the world 
– as long as you have an internet connection.  
Onshape takes it one step beyond this.   
Firstly, Onshape is entire ly 100% cloud -based.  This means you don’t have to install a ny 
software.  You don’t have to get permission from your IT department to put the software on your workstation , and you don’t use up any space on your hard drive or jump drive or wherever 
you like to store files.  Everything happens on Onshape’ s servers.   
Because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, it is accessible from any device that uses a browser, 
like Firefox or Chrome.  This means that you can pull up Onshape with any internet connection on your tablet, smart phone, laptop, or work station.  Onshape even  offers apps for Android and 
iOS devices.  
Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.   
Onshape does use “cookies,”  so make sure you set your browser to accept cookies.  If th e 
browser interface is not working properly, perform a hard refresh. (H old down Command and 
Shift, then press R in any Apple or Mac operating system.  For a WINDOWS operating system, press Ctl+F5. )  GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

Onshape has two document states:  Public and Private.  If a document is public, anybody with an 
Onshape account can view and download the file.   If you a re the owner or creator of the 
document, you can share it with other users, but the users must have an Onshape account.   
Both public and private documents can be shared.  Sharing a document allows anyone who has 
been provided access to make modifications to the document.  More than one user can edit a 
shared document at a time, similarly to how Google Docs works.   
If you are not the owner/creator of a document, you cannot  share it.  I f you find a public model 
that you like, you can send the URL t o a friend, so they can see it .  Since neither you nor  your 
friend own the model, neither you nor  your friend w ill be able to modify the file.   Alternatively, 
you can make a copy of a public document and own the copy.  Once you own the copy, you can share it w ith anyone you like.  
You can transfer ownership of a document to another user. If you are finished working on a project, you can hand it off to another user and let them take over.

document, you can share it with other users, but the users must have an Onshape account.   
Both public and private documents can be shared.  Sharing a document allows anyone who has 
been provided access to make modifications to the document.  More than one user can edit a 
shared document at a time, similarly to how Google Docs works.   
If you are not the owner/creator of a document, you cannot  share it.  I f you find a public model 
that you like, you can send the URL t o a friend, so they can see it .  Since neither you nor  your 
friend own the model, neither you nor  your friend w ill be able to modify the file.   Alternatively, 
you can make a copy of a public document and own the copy.  Once you own the copy, you can share it w ith anyone you like.  
You can transfer ownership of a document to another user. If you are finished working on a project, you can hand it off to another user and let them take over.

If you want to transfer ownership to another user, select Owner from the drop -down list.  Then 
left click on the Share button.   
For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.  
There is a tutorial that walks you through how to create the stl file once you are satisfied with 
your design.  
When you first create a document, there are three planes in the display window.  The planes are 
named Front, Top, and Right.  These correspond with the front, top, and right views in a 2D drawing.  
The planes are displayed as thin rectangles.  Planes are infinite, but there really isn’t a good way to display an infinite plane.  Think of the plane as a limitless piece of paper.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
15  
In the browser, under Default geometry, the Origin and the three planes are listed.  
 
The origin is the 0,0,0 (x =0, y=0, z=0) point in the 3D universe where you are creating the 
design.  
The origin basically allows you to locate the geometry in relation to 3 -dimensional space.  If you 
don’t provide a location for the lines, circles, and arcs, it could move around and the results 
would not be pretty.  
Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
16  
There are four primary feature types:  
• Extrude  
• Revolve  
• Sweep  
• Loft 
 
For an Extrude, you place a sketch and then add height or thickness.  Common objects 
that use extrudes are boxes.  
 
For a Revolve, you place a sketch and then revolve it around an axis.  An axis can be an edge or 
line.   
Common objects that use revolves are wheels and gears.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
17  
For a Sweep, you create two sketches.  One sketch is the profile and one sketch is the path.  The 
profile travels along the path to create the 3D shape. The two sketches are usually 
perpendicular to each other.  The path would be on one plane, and the profile would be on a 
different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

1 Getting Started  
Explanation of how Onshape Works  
When I started working in CAD in 1982, the emerging software – the new kid on the block – was 
AutoCAD created by a company headquartered  in San Rafael, California named Autodesk.  The 
interface consisted of a screen menu.  You used a keyboard and short cut keys – like L for Line – 
to create your technical drawings, which consisted of lines, arcs, and circles.  There was no 
rendering.  Ther e were no layers.  There was no color.  You drew in white on a black 
background.  At the time, many drafters and designers said that CADD (Computer Aided 
Drafting/Design) software would never replace pencil and paper.  
So, here we are in 2016  and how the wo rld has changed.  Today most CADD software is moving 
to the cloud.  This means that users will download a small software program that allows them to log in to an account and save their work on remote servers.  So, users are no longer tied down to a worksta tion or an office.  You can access your work from any device anywhere in the world 
– as long as you have an internet connection.  
Onshape takes it one step beyond this.   
Firstly, Onshape is entire ly 100% cloud -based.  This means you don’t have to install a ny 
software.  You don’t have to get permission from your IT department to put the software on your workstation , and you don’t use up any space on your hard drive or jump drive or wherever 
you like to store files.  Everything happens on Onshape’ s servers.   
Because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, it is accessible from any device that uses a browser, 
like Firefox or Chrome.  This means that you can pull up Onshape with any internet connection on your tablet, smart phone, laptop, or work station.  Onshape even  offers apps for Android and 
iOS devices.  
Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.   
Onshape does use “cookies,”  so make sure you set your browser to accept cookies.  If th e 
browser interface is not working properly, perform a hard refresh. (H old down Command and 
Shift, then press R in any Apple or Mac operating system.  For a WINDOWS operating system, press Ctl+F5. )  GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.   
Onshape does use “cookies,”  so make sure you set your browser to accept cookies.  If th e 
browser interface is not working properly, perform a hard refresh. (H old down Command and 
Shift, then press R in any Apple or Mac operating system.  For a WINDOWS operating system, press Ctl+F5. )  GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

Onshape has two document states:  Public and Private.  If a document is public, anybody with an 
Onshape account can view and download the file.   If you a re the owner or creator of the 
document, you can share it with other users, but the users must have an Onshape account.   
Both public and private documents can be shared.  Sharing a document allows anyone who has 
been provided access to make modifications to the document.  More than one user can edit a 
shared document at a time, similarly to how Google Docs works.   
If you are not the owner/creator of a document, you cannot  share it.  I f you find a public model 
that you like, you can send the URL t o a friend, so they can see it .  Since neither you nor  your 
friend own the model, neither you nor  your friend w ill be able to modify the file.   Alternatively, 
you can make a copy of a public document and own the copy.  Once you own the copy, you can share it w ith anyone you like.  
You can transfer ownership of a document to another user. If you are finished working on a project, you can hand it off to another user and let them take over.

For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.  
There is a tutorial that walks you through how to create the stl file once you are satisfied with 
your design.  
When you first create a document, there are three planes in the display window.  The planes are 
named Front, Top, and Right.  These correspond with the front, top, and right views in a 2D drawing.  
The planes are displayed as thin rectangles.  Planes are infinite, but there really isn’t a good way to display an infinite plane.  Think of the plane as a limitless piece of paper.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
15  
In the browser, under Default geometry, the Origin and the three planes are listed.  
 
The origin is the 0,0,0 (x =0, y=0, z=0) point in the 3D universe where you are creating the 
design.  
The origin basically allows you to locate the geometry in relation to 3 -dimensional space.  If you 
don’t provide a location for the lines, circles, and arcs, it could move around and the results 
would not be pretty.  
Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
16  
There are four primary feature types:  
• Extrude  
• Revolve  
• Sweep  
• Loft 
 
For an Extrude, you place a sketch and then add height or thickness.  Common objects 
that use extrudes are boxes.  
 
For a Revolve, you place a sketch and then revolve it around an axis.  An axis can be an edge or 
line.   
Common objects that use revolves are wheels and gears.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
17  
For a Sweep, you create two sketches.  One sketch is the profile and one sketch is the path.  The 
profile travels along the path to create the 3D shape. The two sketches are usually 
perpendicular to each other.  The path would be on one plane, and the profile would be on a 
different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

1 Getting Started  
Explanation of how Onshape Works  
When I started working in CAD in 1982, the emerging software – the new kid on the block – was 
AutoCAD created by a company headquartered  in San Rafael, California named Autodesk.  The 
interface consisted of a screen menu.  You used a keyboard and short cut keys – like L for Line – 
to create your technical drawings, which consisted of lines, arcs, and circles.  There was no 
rendering.  Ther e were no layers.  There was no color.  You drew in white on a black 
background.  At the time, many drafters and designers said that CADD (Computer Aided 
Drafting/Design) software would never replace pencil and paper.  
So, here we are in 2016  and how the wo rld has changed.  Today most CADD software is moving 
to the cloud.  This means that users will download a small software program that allows them to log in to an account and save their work on remote servers.  So, users are no longer tied down to a worksta tion or an office.  You can access your work from any device anywhere in the world 
– as long as you have an internet connection.  
Onshape takes it one step beyond this.   
Firstly, Onshape is entire ly 100% cloud -based.  This means you don’t have to install a ny 
software.  You don’t have to get permission from your IT department to put the software on your workstation , and you don’t use up any space on your hard drive or jump drive or wherever 
you like to store files.  Everything happens on Onshape’ s servers.   
Because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, it is accessible from any device that uses a browser, 
like Firefox or Chrome.  This means that you can pull up Onshape with any internet connection on your tablet, smart phone, laptop, or work station.  Onshape even  offers apps for Android and 
iOS devices.  
Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.   
Onshape does use “cookies,”  so make sure you set your browser to accept cookies.  If th e 
browser interface is not working properly, perform a hard refresh. (H old down Command and 
Shift, then press R in any Apple or Mac operating system.  For a WINDOWS operating system, press Ctl+F5. )  GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or

1 Getting Started  
Explanation of how Onshape Works  
When I started working in CAD in 1982, the emerging software – the new kid on the block – was 
AutoCAD created by a company headquartered  in San Rafael, California named Autodesk.  The 
interface consisted of a screen menu.  You used a keyboard and short cut keys – like L for Line – 
to create your technical drawings, which consisted of lines, arcs, and circles.  There was no 
rendering.  Ther e were no layers.  There was no color.  You drew in white on a black 
background.  At the time, many drafters and designers said that CADD (Computer Aided 
Drafting/Design) software would never replace pencil and paper.  
So, here we are in 2016  and how the wo rld has changed.  Today most CADD software is moving 
to the cloud.  This means that users will download a small software program that allows them to log in to an account and save their work on remote servers.  So, users are no longer tied down to a worksta tion or an office.  You can access your work from any device anywhere in the world 
– as long as you have an internet connection.  
Onshape takes it one step beyond this.   
Firstly, Onshape is entire ly 100% cloud -based.  This means you don’t have to install a ny 
software.  You don’t have to get permission from your IT department to put the software on your workstation , and you don’t use up any space on your hard drive or jump drive or wherever 
you like to store files.  Everything happens on Onshape’ s servers.   
Because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, it is accessible from any device that uses a browser, 
like Firefox or Chrome.  This means that you can pull up Onshape with any internet connection on your tablet, smart phone, laptop, or work station.  Onshape even  offers apps for Android and 
iOS devices.  
Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.   
Onshape does use “cookies,”  so make sure you set your browser to accept cookies.  If th e 
browser interface is not working properly, perform a hard refresh. (H old down Command and 
Shift, then press R in any Apple or Mac operating system.  For a WINDOWS operating system, press Ctl+F5. )  GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

added Onshape to your contacts list.  
 
6. Select the link  that is provided in the email . 
 
7. Set up a password for the account. Be sure to write it down somewhere! Press the Sign Up button and Onshape will immediately launch.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
4 8. You start in the Tutorials and Samples area.  
 
Onshape has two document states:  Public and Private.  If a document is public, anybody with an 
Onshape account can view and download the file.   If you a re the owner or creator of the 
document, you can share it with other users, but the users must have an Onshape account.   
Both public and private documents can be shared.  Sharing a document allows anyone who has 
been provided access to make modifications to the document.  More than one user can edit a 
shared document at a time, similarly to how Google Docs works.   
If you are not the owner/creator of a document, you cannot  share it.  I f you find a public model 
that you like, you can send the URL t o a friend, so they can see it .  Since neither you nor  your 
friend own the model, neither you nor  your friend w ill be able to modify the file.   Alternatively, 
you can make a copy of a public document and own the copy.  Once you own the copy, you can share it w ith anyone you like.  
You can transfer ownership of a document to another user. If you are finished working on a project, you can hand it off to another user and let them take over.

If you want to transfer ownership to another user, select Owner from the drop -down list.  Then 
left click on the Share button.   
For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.  
There is a tutorial that walks you through how to create the stl file once you are satisfied with 
your design.  
When you first create a document, there are three planes in the display window.  The planes are 
named Front, Top, and Right.  These correspond with the front, top, and right views in a 2D drawing.  
The planes are displayed as thin rectangles.  Planes are infinite, but there really isn’t a good way to display an infinite plane.  Think of the plane as a limitless piece of paper.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
15  
In the browser, under Default geometry, the Origin and the three planes are listed.  
 
The origin is the 0,0,0 (x =0, y=0, z=0) point in the 3D universe where you are creating the 
design.  
The origin basically allows you to locate the geometry in relation to 3 -dimensional space.  If you 
don’t provide a location for the lines, circles, and arcs, it could move around and the results 
would not be pretty.  
Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
16  
There are four primary feature types:  
• Extrude  
• Revolve  
• Sweep  
• Loft 
 
For an Extrude, you place a sketch and then add height or thickness.  Common objects 
that use extrudes are boxes.  
 
For a Revolve, you place a sketch and then revolve it around an axis.  An axis can be an edge or 
line.   
Common objects that use revolves are wheels and gears.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
17  
For a Sweep, you create two sketches.  One sketch is the profile and one sketch is the path.  The 
profile travels along the path to create the 3D shape. The two sketches are usually 
perpendicular to each other.  The path would be on one plane, and the profile would be on a 
different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

1 Getting Started  
Explanation of how Onshape Works  
When I started working in CAD in 1982, the emerging software – the new kid on the block – was 
AutoCAD created by a company headquartered  in San Rafael, California named Autodesk.  The 
interface consisted of a screen menu.  You used a keyboard and short cut keys – like L for Line – 
to create your technical drawings, which consisted of lines, arcs, and circles.  There was no 
rendering.  Ther e were no layers.  There was no color.  You drew in white on a black 
background.  At the time, many drafters and designers said that CADD (Computer Aided 
Drafting/Design) software would never replace pencil and paper.  
So, here we are in 2016  and how the wo rld has changed.  Today most CADD software is moving 
to the cloud.  This means that users will download a small software program that allows them to log in to an account and save their work on remote servers.  So, users are no longer tied down to a worksta tion or an office.  You can access your work from any device anywhere in the world 
– as long as you have an internet connection.  
Onshape takes it one step beyond this.   
Firstly, Onshape is entire ly 100% cloud -based.  This means you don’t have to install a ny 
software.  You don’t have to get permission from your IT department to put the software on your workstation , and you don’t use up any space on your hard drive or jump drive or wherever 
you like to store files.  Everything happens on Onshape’ s servers.   
Because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, it is accessible from any device that uses a browser, 
like Firefox or Chrome.  This means that you can pull up Onshape with any internet connection on your tablet, smart phone, laptop, or work station.  Onshape even  offers apps for Android and 
iOS devices.  
Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.   
Onshape does use “cookies,”  so make sure you set your browser to accept cookies.  If th e 
browser interface is not working properly, perform a hard refresh. (H old down Command and 
Shift, then press R in any Apple or Mac operating system.  For a WINDOWS operating system, press Ctl+F5. )  GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

4 8. You start in the Tutorials and Samples area.  
 
Onshape has two document states:  Public and Private.  If a document is public, anybody with an 
Onshape account can view and download the file.   If you a re the owner or creator of the 
document, you can share it with other users, but the users must have an Onshape account.   
Both public and private documents can be shared.  Sharing a document allows anyone who has 
been provided access to make modifications to the document.  More than one user can edit a 
shared document at a time, similarly to how Google Docs works.   
If you are not the owner/creator of a document, you cannot  share it.  I f you find a public model 
that you like, you can send the URL t o a friend, so they can see it .  Since neither you nor  your 
friend own the model, neither you nor  your friend w ill be able to modify the file.   Alternatively, 
you can make a copy of a public document and own the copy.  Once you own the copy, you can share it w ith anyone you like.  
You can transfer ownership of a document to another user. If you are finished working on a project, you can hand it off to another user and let them take over.

Estimated Time:  5 minutes  
Objectives:   
• Collaboration  
 
1. Login to Onshape. Locate the Wind Meter which was copied to the My Documents area. 
Left click to open  the document.  
 
2. Left click on the Share button.

wish to share the document. Anybody you share a document with is called a 
Collaborator. Press Share.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
14 4. The Collaborator’s  email is now listed. Press Close . 
 
 
If you want to transfer ownership to another user, select Owner from the drop -down list.  Then 
left click on the Share button.   
For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.  
There is a tutorial that walks you through how to create the stl file once you are satisfied with 
your design.  
When you first create a document, there are three planes in the display window.  The planes are 
named Front, Top, and Right.  These correspond with the front, top, and right views in a 2D drawing.  
The planes are displayed as thin rectangles.  Planes are infinite, but there really isn’t a good way to display an infinite plane.  Think of the plane as a limitless piece of paper.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
15  
In the browser, under Default geometry, the Origin and the three planes are listed.  
 
The origin is the 0,0,0 (x =0, y=0, z=0) point in the 3D universe where you are creating the 
design.  
The origin basically allows you to locate the geometry in relation to 3 -dimensional space.  If you 
don’t provide a location for the lines, circles, and arcs, it could move around and the results 
would not be pretty.  
Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
16  
There are four primary feature types:  
• Extrude  
• Revolve  
• Sweep  
• Loft 
 
For an Extrude, you place a sketch and then add height or thickness.  Common objects 
that use extrudes are boxes.  
 
For a Revolve, you place a sketch and then revolve it around an axis.  An axis can be an edge or 
line.   
Common objects that use revolves are wheels and gears.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
17  
For a Sweep, you create two sketches.  One sketch is the profile and one sketch is the path.  The 
profile travels along the path to create the 3D shape. The two sketches are usually 
perpendicular to each other.  The path would be on one plane, and the profile would be on a 
different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.

19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated

you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.  
There is a tutorial that walks you through how to create the stl file once you are satisfied with 
your design.  
When you first create a document, there are three planes in the display window.  The planes are 
named Front, Top, and Right.  These correspond with the front, top, and right views in a 2D drawing.  
The planes are displayed as thin rectangles.  Planes are infinite, but there really isn’t a good way to display an infinite plane.  Think of the plane as a limitless piece of paper.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
15  
In the browser, under Default geometry, the Origin and the three planes are listed.  
 
The origin is the 0,0,0 (x =0, y=0, z=0) point in the 3D universe where you are creating the 
design.  
The origin basically allows you to locate the geometry in relation to 3 -dimensional space.  If you 
don’t provide a location for the lines, circles, and arcs, it could move around and the results 
would not be pretty.  
Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
16  
There are four primary feature types:  
• Extrude  
• Revolve  
• Sweep  
• Loft 
 
For an Extrude, you place a sketch and then add height or thickness.  Common objects 
that use extrudes are boxes.  
 
For a Revolve, you place a sketch and then revolve it around an axis.  An axis can be an edge or 
line.   
Common objects that use revolves are wheels and gears.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
17  
For a Sweep, you create two sketches.  One sketch is the profile and one sketch is the path.  The 
profile travels along the path to create the 3D shape. The two sketches are usually 
perpendicular to each other.  The path would be on one plane, and the profile would be on a 
different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

1 Getting Started  
Explanation of how Onshape Works  
When I started working in CAD in 1982, the emerging software – the new kid on the block – was 
AutoCAD created by a company headquartered  in San Rafael, California named Autodesk.  The 
interface consisted of a screen menu.  You used a keyboard and short cut keys – like L for Line – 
to create your technical drawings, which consisted of lines, arcs, and circles.  There was no 
rendering.  Ther e were no layers.  There was no color.  You drew in white on a black 
background.  At the time, many drafters and designers said that CADD (Computer Aided 
Drafting/Design) software would never replace pencil and paper.  
So, here we are in 2016  and how the wo rld has changed.  Today most CADD software is moving 
to the cloud.  This means that users will download a small software program that allows them to log in to an account and save their work on remote servers.  So, users are no longer tied down to a worksta tion or an office.  You can access your work from any device anywhere in the world 
– as long as you have an internet connection.  
Onshape takes it one step beyond this.   
Firstly, Onshape is entire ly 100% cloud -based.  This means you don’t have to install a ny 
software.  You don’t have to get permission from your IT department to put the software on your workstation , and you don’t use up any space on your hard drive or jump drive or wherever 
you like to store files.  Everything happens on Onshape’ s servers.   
Because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, it is accessible from any device that uses a browser, 
like Firefox or Chrome.  This means that you can pull up Onshape with any internet connection on your tablet, smart phone, laptop, or work station.  Onshape even  offers apps for Android and 
iOS devices.  
Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.   
Onshape does use “cookies,”  so make sure you set your browser to accept cookies.  If th e 
browser interface is not working properly, perform a hard refresh. (H old down Command and 
Shift, then press R in any Apple or Mac operating system.  For a WINDOWS operating system, press Ctl+F5. )  GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

7. Set up a password for the account. Be sure to write it down somewhere! Press the Sign Up button and Onshape will immediately launch.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
4 8. You start in the Tutorials and Samples area.  
 
Onshape has two document states:  Public and Private.  If a document is public, anybody with an 
Onshape account can view and download the file.   If you a re the owner or creator of the 
document, you can share it with other users, but the users must have an Onshape account.   
Both public and private documents can be shared.  Sharing a document allows anyone who has 
been provided access to make modifications to the document.  More than one user can edit a 
shared document at a time, similarly to how Google Docs works.   
If you are not the owner/creator of a document, you cannot  share it.  I f you find a public model 
that you like, you can send the URL t o a friend, so they can see it .  Since neither you nor  your 
friend own the model, neither you nor  your friend w ill be able to modify the file.   Alternatively, 
you can make a copy of a public document and own the copy.  Once you own the copy, you can share it w ith anyone you like.  
You can transfer ownership of a document to another user. If you are finished working on a project, you can hand it off to another user and let them take over.

For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.

For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.  
There is a tutorial that walks you through how to create the stl file once you are satisfied with 
your design.  
When you first create a document, there are three planes in the display window.  The planes are 
named Front, Top, and Right.  These correspond with the front, top, and right views in a 2D drawing.  
The planes are displayed as thin rectangles.  Planes are infinite, but there really isn’t a good way to display an infinite plane.  Think of the plane as a limitless piece of paper.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
15  
In the browser, under Default geometry, the Origin and the three planes are listed.  
 
The origin is the 0,0,0 (x =0, y=0, z=0) point in the 3D universe where you are creating the 
design.  
The origin basically allows you to locate the geometry in relation to 3 -dimensional space.  If you 
don’t provide a location for the lines, circles, and arcs, it could move around and the results 
would not be pretty.  
Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
16  
There are four primary feature types:  
• Extrude  
• Revolve  
• Sweep  
• Loft 
 
For an Extrude, you place a sketch and then add height or thickness.  Common objects 
that use extrudes are boxes.  
 
For a Revolve, you place a sketch and then revolve it around an axis.  An axis can be an edge or 
line.   
Common objects that use revolves are wheels and gears.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
17  
For a Sweep, you create two sketches.  One sketch is the profile and one sketch is the path.  The 
profile travels along the path to create the 3D shape. The two sketches are usually 
perpendicular to each other.  The path would be on one plane, and the profile would be on a 
different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

1 Getting Started  
Explanation of how Onshape Works  
When I started working in CAD in 1982, the emerging software – the new kid on the block – was 
AutoCAD created by a company headquartered  in San Rafael, California named Autodesk.  The 
interface consisted of a screen menu.  You used a keyboard and short cut keys – like L for Line – 
to create your technical drawings, which consisted of lines, arcs, and circles.  There was no 
rendering.  Ther e were no layers.  There was no color.  You drew in white on a black 
background.  At the time, many drafters and designers said that CADD (Computer Aided 
Drafting/Design) software would never replace pencil and paper.  
So, here we are in 2016  and how the wo rld has changed.  Today most CADD software is moving 
to the cloud.  This means that users will download a small software program that allows them to log in to an account and save their work on remote servers.  So, users are no longer tied down to a worksta tion or an office.  You can access your work from any device anywhere in the world 
– as long as you have an internet connection.  
Onshape takes it one step beyond this.   
Firstly, Onshape is entire ly 100% cloud -based.  This means you don’t have to install a ny 
software.  You don’t have to get permission from your IT department to put the software on your workstation , and you don’t use up any space on your hard drive or jump drive or wherever 
you like to store files.  Everything happens on Onshape’ s servers.   
Because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, it is accessible from any device that uses a browser, 
like Firefox or Chrome.  This means that you can pull up Onshape with any internet connection on your tablet, smart phone, laptop, or work station.  Onshape even  offers apps for Android and 
iOS devices.  
Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.   
Onshape does use “cookies,”  so make sure you set your browser to accept cookies.  If th e 
browser interface is not working properly, perform a hard refresh. (H old down Command and 
Shift, then press R in any Apple or Mac operating system.  For a WINDOWS operating system, press Ctl+F5. )  GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

4 8. You start in the Tutorials and Samples area.  
 
Onshape has two document states:  Public and Private.  If a document is public, anybody with an 
Onshape account can view and download the file.   If you a re the owner or creator of the 
document, you can share it with other users, but the users must have an Onshape account.   
Both public and private documents can be shared.  Sharing a document allows anyone who has 
been provided access to make modifications to the document.  More than one user can edit a 
shared document at a time, similarly to how Google Docs works.   
If you are not the owner/creator of a document, you cannot  share it.  I f you find a public model 
that you like, you can send the URL t o a friend, so they can see it .  Since neither you nor  your 
friend own the model, neither you nor  your friend w ill be able to modify the file.   Alternatively, 
you can make a copy of a public document and own the copy.  Once you own the copy, you can share it w ith anyone you like.  
You can transfer ownership of a document to another user. If you are finished working on a project, you can hand it off to another user and let them take over.

If you want to transfer ownership to another user, select Owner from the drop -down list.  Then 
left click on the Share button.   
For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.  
There is a tutorial that walks you through how to create the stl file once you are satisfied with 
your design.  
When you first create a document, there are three planes in the display window.  The planes are 
named Front, Top, and Right.  These correspond with the front, top, and right views in a 2D drawing.  
The planes are displayed as thin rectangles.  Planes are infinite, but there really isn’t a good way to display an infinite plane.  Think of the plane as a limitless piece of paper.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
15  
In the browser, under Default geometry, the Origin and the three planes are listed.  
 
The origin is the 0,0,0 (x =0, y=0, z=0) point in the 3D universe where you are creating the 
design.  
The origin basically allows you to locate the geometry in relation to 3 -dimensional space.  If you 
don’t provide a location for the lines, circles, and arcs, it could move around and the results 
would not be pretty.  
Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
16  
There are four primary feature types:  
• Extrude  
• Revolve  
• Sweep  
• Loft 
 
For an Extrude, you place a sketch and then add height or thickness.  Common objects 
that use extrudes are boxes.  
 
For a Revolve, you place a sketch and then revolve it around an axis.  An axis can be an edge or 
line.   
Common objects that use revolves are wheels and gears.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
17  
For a Sweep, you create two sketches.  One sketch is the profile and one sketch is the path.  The 
profile travels along the path to create the 3D shape. The two sketches are usually 
perpendicular to each other.  The path would be on one plane, and the profile would be on a 
different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

1 Getting Started  
Explanation of how Onshape Works  
When I started working in CAD in 1982, the emerging software – the new kid on the block – was 
AutoCAD created by a company headquartered  in San Rafael, California named Autodesk.  The 
interface consisted of a screen menu.  You used a keyboard and short cut keys – like L for Line – 
to create your technical drawings, which consisted of lines, arcs, and circles.  There was no 
rendering.  Ther e were no layers.  There was no color.  You drew in white on a black 
background.  At the time, many drafters and designers said that CADD (Computer Aided 
Drafting/Design) software would never replace pencil and paper.  
So, here we are in 2016  and how the wo rld has changed.  Today most CADD software is moving 
to the cloud.  This means that users will download a small software program that allows them to log in to an account and save their work on remote servers.  So, users are no longer tied down to a worksta tion or an office.  You can access your work from any device anywhere in the world 
– as long as you have an internet connection.  
Onshape takes it one step beyond this.   
Firstly, Onshape is entire ly 100% cloud -based.  This means you don’t have to install a ny 
software.  You don’t have to get permission from your IT department to put the software on your workstation , and you don’t use up any space on your hard drive or jump drive or wherever 
you like to store files.  Everything happens on Onshape’ s servers.   
Because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, it is accessible from any device that uses a browser, 
like Firefox or Chrome.  This means that you can pull up Onshape with any internet connection on your tablet, smart phone, laptop, or work station.  Onshape even  offers apps for Android and 
iOS devices.  
Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.   
Onshape does use “cookies,”  so make sure you set your browser to accept cookies.  If th e 
browser interface is not working properly, perform a hard refresh. (H old down Command and 
Shift, then press R in any Apple or Mac operating system.  For a WINDOWS operating system, press Ctl+F5. )  GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

4 8. You start in the Tutorials and Samples area.  
 
Onshape has two document states:  Public and Private.  If a document is public, anybody with an 
Onshape account can view and download the file.   If you a re the owner or creator of the 
document, you can share it with other users, but the users must have an Onshape account.   
Both public and private documents can be shared.  Sharing a document allows anyone who has 
been provided access to make modifications to the document.  More than one user can edit a 
shared document at a time, similarly to how Google Docs works.   
If you are not the owner/creator of a document, you cannot  share it.  I f you find a public model 
that you like, you can send the URL t o a friend, so they can see it .  Since neither you nor  your 
friend own the model, neither you nor  your friend w ill be able to modify the file.   Alternatively, 
you can make a copy of a public document and own the copy.  Once you own the copy, you can share it w ith anyone you like.  
You can transfer ownership of a document to another user. If you are finished working on a project, you can hand it off to another user and let them take over.

Onshape has two document states:  Public and Private.  If a document is public, anybody with an 
Onshape account can view and download the file.   If you a re the owner or creator of the 
document, you can share it with other users, but the users must have an Onshape account.   
Both public and private documents can be shared.  Sharing a document allows anyone who has 
been provided access to make modifications to the document.  More than one user can edit a 
shared document at a time, similarly to how Google Docs works.   
If you are not the owner/creator of a document, you cannot  share it.  I f you find a public model 
that you like, you can send the URL t o a friend, so they can see it .  Since neither you nor  your 
friend own the model, neither you nor  your friend w ill be able to modify the file.   Alternatively, 
you can make a copy of a public document and own the copy.  Once you own the copy, you can share it w ith anyone you like.  
You can transfer ownership of a document to another user. If you are finished working on a project, you can hand it off to another user and let them take over.

For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.  
There is a tutorial that walks you through how to create the stl file once you are satisfied with 
your design.  
When you first create a document, there are three planes in the display window.  The planes are 
named Front, Top, and Right.  These correspond with the front, top, and right views in a 2D drawing.  
The planes are displayed as thin rectangles.  Planes are infinite, but there really isn’t a good way to display an infinite plane.  Think of the plane as a limitless piece of paper.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
15  
In the browser, under Default geometry, the Origin and the three planes are listed.  
 
The origin is the 0,0,0 (x =0, y=0, z=0) point in the 3D universe where you are creating the 
design.  
The origin basically allows you to locate the geometry in relation to 3 -dimensional space.  If you 
don’t provide a location for the lines, circles, and arcs, it could move around and the results 
would not be pretty.  
Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
16  
There are four primary feature types:  
• Extrude  
• Revolve  
• Sweep  
• Loft 
 
For an Extrude, you place a sketch and then add height or thickness.  Common objects 
that use extrudes are boxes.  
 
For a Revolve, you place a sketch and then revolve it around an axis.  An axis can be an edge or 
line.   
Common objects that use revolves are wheels and gears.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
17  
For a Sweep, you create two sketches.  One sketch is the profile and one sketch is the path.  The 
profile travels along the path to create the 3D shape. The two sketches are usually 
perpendicular to each other.  The path would be on one plane, and the profile would be on a 
different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

1 Getting Started  
Explanation of how Onshape Works  
When I started working in CAD in 1982, the emerging software – the new kid on the block – was 
AutoCAD created by a company headquartered  in San Rafael, California named Autodesk.  The 
interface consisted of a screen menu.  You used a keyboard and short cut keys – like L for Line – 
to create your technical drawings, which consisted of lines, arcs, and circles.  There was no 
rendering.  Ther e were no layers.  There was no color.  You drew in white on a black 
background.  At the time, many drafters and designers said that CADD (Computer Aided 
Drafting/Design) software would never replace pencil and paper.  
So, here we are in 2016  and how the wo rld has changed.  Today most CADD software is moving 
to the cloud.  This means that users will download a small software program that allows them to log in to an account and save their work on remote servers.  So, users are no longer tied down to a worksta tion or an office.  You can access your work from any device anywhere in the world 
– as long as you have an internet connection.  
Onshape takes it one step beyond this.   
Firstly, Onshape is entire ly 100% cloud -based.  This means you don’t have to install a ny 
software.  You don’t have to get permission from your IT department to put the software on your workstation , and you don’t use up any space on your hard drive or jump drive or wherever 
you like to store files.  Everything happens on Onshape’ s servers.   
Because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, it is accessible from any device that uses a browser, 
like Firefox or Chrome.  This means that you can pull up Onshape with any internet connection on your tablet, smart phone, laptop, or work station.  Onshape even  offers apps for Android and 
iOS devices.  
Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.   
Onshape does use “cookies,”  so make sure you set your browser to accept cookies.  If th e 
browser interface is not working properly, perform a hard refresh. (H old down Command and 
Shift, then press R in any Apple or Mac operating system.  For a WINDOWS operating system, press Ctl+F5. )  GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

Drafting/Design) software would never replace pencil and paper.  
So, here we are in 2016  and how the wo rld has changed.  Today most CADD software is moving 
to the cloud.  This means that users will download a small software program that allows them to log in to an account and save their work on remote servers.  So, users are no longer tied down to a worksta tion or an office.  You can access your work from any device anywhere in the world 
– as long as you have an internet connection.  
Onshape takes it one step beyond this.   
Firstly, Onshape is entire ly 100% cloud -based.  This means you don’t have to install a ny 
software.  You don’t have to get permission from your IT department to put the software on your workstation , and you don’t use up any space on your hard drive or jump drive or wherever 
you like to store files.  Everything happens on Onshape’ s servers.   
Because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, it is accessible from any device that uses a browser, 
like Firefox or Chrome.  This means that you can pull up Onshape with any internet connection on your tablet, smart phone, laptop, or work station.  Onshape even  offers apps for Android and 
iOS devices.  
Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.   
Onshape does use “cookies,”  so make sure you set your browser to accept cookies.  If th e 
browser interface is not working properly, perform a hard refresh. (H old down Command and 
Shift, then press R in any Apple or Mac operating system.  For a WINDOWS operating system, press Ctl+F5. )  GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

Onshape has two document states:  Public and Private.  If a document is public, anybody with an 
Onshape account can view and download the file.   If you a re the owner or creator of the 
document, you can share it with other users, but the users must have an Onshape account.   
Both public and private documents can be shared.  Sharing a document allows anyone who has 
been provided access to make modifications to the document.  More than one user can edit a 
shared document at a time, similarly to how Google Docs works.   
If you are not the owner/creator of a document, you cannot  share it.  I f you find a public model 
that you like, you can send the URL t o a friend, so they can see it .  Since neither you nor  your 
friend own the model, neither you nor  your friend w ill be able to modify the file.   Alternatively, 
you can make a copy of a public document and own the copy.  Once you own the copy, you can share it w ith anyone you like.  
You can transfer ownership of a document to another user. If you are finished working on a project, you can hand it off to another user and let them take over.

For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.  
There is a tutorial that walks you through how to create the stl file once you are satisfied with 
your design.  
When you first create a document, there are three planes in the display window.  The planes are 
named Front, Top, and Right.  These correspond with the front, top, and right views in a 2D drawing.  
The planes are displayed as thin rectangles.  Planes are infinite, but there really isn’t a good way to display an infinite plane.  Think of the plane as a limitless piece of paper.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
15  
In the browser, under Default geometry, the Origin and the three planes are listed.  
 
The origin is the 0,0,0 (x =0, y=0, z=0) point in the 3D universe where you are creating the 
design.  
The origin basically allows you to locate the geometry in relation to 3 -dimensional space.  If you 
don’t provide a location for the lines, circles, and arcs, it could move around and the results 
would not be pretty.  
Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
16  
There are four primary feature types:  
• Extrude  
• Revolve  
• Sweep  
• Loft 
 
For an Extrude, you place a sketch and then add height or thickness.  Common objects 
that use extrudes are boxes.  
 
For a Revolve, you place a sketch and then revolve it around an axis.  An axis can be an edge or 
line.   
Common objects that use revolves are wheels and gears.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
17  
For a Sweep, you create two sketches.  One sketch is the profile and one sketch is the path.  The 
profile travels along the path to create the 3D shape. The two sketches are usually 
perpendicular to each other.  The path would be on one plane, and the profile would be on a 
different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

1 Getting Started  
Explanation of how Onshape Works  
When I started working in CAD in 1982, the emerging software – the new kid on the block – was 
AutoCAD created by a company headquartered  in San Rafael, California named Autodesk.  The 
interface consisted of a screen menu.  You used a keyboard and short cut keys – like L for Line – 
to create your technical drawings, which consisted of lines, arcs, and circles.  There was no 
rendering.  Ther e were no layers.  There was no color.  You drew in white on a black 
background.  At the time, many drafters and designers said that CADD (Computer Aided 
Drafting/Design) software would never replace pencil and paper.  
So, here we are in 2016  and how the wo rld has changed.  Today most CADD software is moving 
to the cloud.  This means that users will download a small software program that allows them to log in to an account and save their work on remote servers.  So, users are no longer tied down to a worksta tion or an office.  You can access your work from any device anywhere in the world 
– as long as you have an internet connection.  
Onshape takes it one step beyond this.   
Firstly, Onshape is entire ly 100% cloud -based.  This means you don’t have to install a ny 
software.  You don’t have to get permission from your IT department to put the software on your workstation , and you don’t use up any space on your hard drive or jump drive or wherever 
you like to store files.  Everything happens on Onshape’ s servers.   
Because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, it is accessible from any device that uses a browser, 
like Firefox or Chrome.  This means that you can pull up Onshape with any internet connection on your tablet, smart phone, laptop, or work station.  Onshape even  offers apps for Android and 
iOS devices.  
Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.

For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.

When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

1 Getting Started  
Explanation of how Onshape Works  
When I started working in CAD in 1982, the emerging software – the new kid on the block – was 
AutoCAD created by a company headquartered  in San Rafael, California named Autodesk.  The 
interface consisted of a screen menu.  You used a keyboard and short cut keys – like L for Line – 
to create your technical drawings, which consisted of lines, arcs, and circles.  There was no 
rendering.  Ther e were no layers.  There was no color.  You drew in white on a black 
background.  At the time, many drafters and designers said that CADD (Computer Aided 
Drafting/Design) software would never replace pencil and paper.  
So, here we are in 2016  and how the wo rld has changed.  Today most CADD software is moving 
to the cloud.  This means that users will download a small software program that allows them to log in to an account and save their work on remote servers.  So, users are no longer tied down to a worksta tion or an office.  You can access your work from any device anywhere in the world 
– as long as you have an internet connection.  
Onshape takes it one step beyond this.   
Firstly, Onshape is entire ly 100% cloud -based.  This means you don’t have to install a ny 
software.  You don’t have to get permission from your IT department to put the software on your workstation , and you don’t use up any space on your hard drive or jump drive or wherever 
you like to store files.  Everything happens on Onshape’ s servers.   
Because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, it is accessible from any device that uses a browser, 
like Firefox or Chrome.  This means that you can pull up Onshape with any internet connection on your tablet, smart phone, laptop, or work station.  Onshape even  offers apps for Android and 
iOS devices.  
Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.   
Onshape does use “cookies,”  so make sure you set your browser to accept cookies.  If th e 
browser interface is not working properly, perform a hard refresh. (H old down Command and 
Shift, then press R in any Apple or Mac operating system.  For a WINDOWS operating system, press Ctl+F5. )  GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

4 8. You start in the Tutorials and Samples area.  
 
Onshape has two document states:  Public and Private.  If a document is public, anybody with an 
Onshape account can view and download the file.   If you a re the owner or creator of the 
document, you can share it with other users, but the users must have an Onshape account.   
Both public and private documents can be shared.  Sharing a document allows anyone who has 
been provided access to make modifications to the document.  More than one user can edit a 
shared document at a time, similarly to how Google Docs works.   
If you are not the owner/creator of a document, you cannot  share it.  I f you find a public model 
that you like, you can send the URL t o a friend, so they can see it .  Since neither you nor  your 
friend own the model, neither you nor  your friend w ill be able to modify the file.   Alternatively, 
you can make a copy of a public document and own the copy.  Once you own the copy, you can share it w ith anyone you like.  
You can transfer ownership of a document to another user. If you are finished working on a project, you can hand it off to another user and let them take over.

If you want to transfer ownership to another user, select Owner from the drop -down list.  Then 
left click on the Share button.   
For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.  
There is a tutorial that walks you through how to create the stl file once you are satisfied with 
your design.  
When you first create a document, there are three planes in the display window.  The planes are 
named Front, Top, and Right.  These correspond with the front, top, and right views in a 2D drawing.  
The planes are displayed as thin rectangles.  Planes are infinite, but there really isn’t a good way to display an infinite plane.  Think of the plane as a limitless piece of paper.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
15  
In the browser, under Default geometry, the Origin and the three planes are listed.  
 
The origin is the 0,0,0 (x =0, y=0, z=0) point in the 3D universe where you are creating the 
design.  
The origin basically allows you to locate the geometry in relation to 3 -dimensional space.  If you 
don’t provide a location for the lines, circles, and arcs, it could move around and the results 
would not be pretty.  
Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
16  
There are four primary feature types:  
• Extrude  
• Revolve  
• Sweep  
• Loft 
 
For an Extrude, you place a sketch and then add height or thickness.  Common objects 
that use extrudes are boxes.  
 
For a Revolve, you place a sketch and then revolve it around an axis.  An axis can be an edge or 
line.   
Common objects that use revolves are wheels and gears.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
17  
For a Sweep, you create two sketches.  One sketch is the profile and one sketch is the path.  The 
profile travels along the path to create the 3D shape. The two sketches are usually 
perpendicular to each other.  The path would be on one plane, and the profile would be on a 
different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

don’t provide a location for the lines, circles, and arcs, it could move around and the results 
would not be pretty.  
Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
16  
There are four primary feature types:  
• Extrude  
• Revolve  
• Sweep  
• Loft 
 
For an Extrude, you place a sketch and then add height or thickness.  Common objects 
that use extrudes are boxes.  
 
For a Revolve, you place a sketch and then revolve it around an axis.  An axis can be an edge or 
line.   
Common objects that use revolves are wheels and gears.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
17  
For a Sweep, you create two sketches.  One sketch is the profile and one sketch is the path.  The 
profile travels along the path to create the 3D shape. The two sketches are usually 
perpendicular to each other.  The path would be on one plane, and the profile would be on a 
different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

1 Getting Started  
Explanation of how Onshape Works  
When I started working in CAD in 1982, the emerging software – the new kid on the block – was 
AutoCAD created by a company headquartered  in San Rafael, California named Autodesk.  The 
interface consisted of a screen menu.  You used a keyboard and short cut keys – like L for Line – 
to create your technical drawings, which consisted of lines, arcs, and circles.  There was no 
rendering.  Ther e were no layers.  There was no color.  You drew in white on a black 
background.  At the time, many drafters and designers said that CADD (Computer Aided 
Drafting/Design) software would never replace pencil and paper.  
So, here we are in 2016  and how the wo rld has changed.  Today most CADD software is moving 
to the cloud.  This means that users will download a small software program that allows them to log in to an account and save their work on remote servers.  So, users are no longer tied down to a worksta tion or an office.  You can access your work from any device anywhere in the world 
– as long as you have an internet connection.  
Onshape takes it one step beyond this.   
Firstly, Onshape is entire ly 100% cloud -based.  This means you don’t have to install a ny 
software.  You don’t have to get permission from your IT department to put the software on your workstation , and you don’t use up any space on your hard drive or jump drive or wherever 
you like to store files.  Everything happens on Onshape’ s servers.   
Because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, it is accessible from any device that uses a browser, 
like Firefox or Chrome.  This means that you can pull up Onshape with any internet connection on your tablet, smart phone, laptop, or work station.  Onshape even  offers apps for Android and 
iOS devices.  
Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.   
Onshape does use “cookies,”  so make sure you set your browser to accept cookies.  If th e 
browser interface is not working properly, perform a hard refresh. (H old down Command and 
Shift, then press R in any Apple or Mac operating system.  For a WINDOWS operating system, press Ctl+F5. )  GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

4 8. You start in the Tutorials and Samples area.  
 
Onshape has two document states:  Public and Private.  If a document is public, anybody with an 
Onshape account can view and download the file.   If you a re the owner or creator of the 
document, you can share it with other users, but the users must have an Onshape account.   
Both public and private documents can be shared.  Sharing a document allows anyone who has 
been provided access to make modifications to the document.  More than one user can edit a 
shared document at a time, similarly to how Google Docs works.   
If you are not the owner/creator of a document, you cannot  share it.  I f you find a public model 
that you like, you can send the URL t o a friend, so they can see it .  Since neither you nor  your 
friend own the model, neither you nor  your friend w ill be able to modify the file.   Alternatively, 
you can make a copy of a public document and own the copy.  Once you own the copy, you can share it w ith anyone you like.  
You can transfer ownership of a document to another user. If you are finished working on a project, you can hand it off to another user and let them take over.

If you want to transfer ownership to another user, select Owner from the drop -down list.  Then 
left click on the Share button.   
For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.  
There is a tutorial that walks you through how to create the stl file once you are satisfied with 
your design.  
When you first create a document, there are three planes in the display window.  The planes are 
named Front, Top, and Right.  These correspond with the front, top, and right views in a 2D drawing.  
The planes are displayed as thin rectangles.  Planes are infinite, but there really isn’t a good way to display an infinite plane.  Think of the plane as a limitless piece of paper.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
15  
In the browser, under Default geometry, the Origin and the three planes are listed.  
 
The origin is the 0,0,0 (x =0, y=0, z=0) point in the 3D universe where you are creating the 
design.  
The origin basically allows you to locate the geometry in relation to 3 -dimensional space.  If you 
don’t provide a location for the lines, circles, and arcs, it could move around and the results 
would not be pretty.  
Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.

different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.

For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.  
There is a tutorial that walks you through how to create the stl file once you are satisfied with 
your design.  
When you first create a document, there are three planes in the display window.  The planes are 
named Front, Top, and Right.  These correspond with the front, top, and right views in a 2D drawing.  
The planes are displayed as thin rectangles.  Planes are infinite, but there really isn’t a good way to display an infinite plane.  Think of the plane as a limitless piece of paper.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
15  
In the browser, under Default geometry, the Origin and the three planes are listed.  
 
The origin is the 0,0,0 (x =0, y=0, z=0) point in the 3D universe where you are creating the 
design.  
The origin basically allows you to locate the geometry in relation to 3 -dimensional space.  If you 
don’t provide a location for the lines, circles, and arcs, it could move around and the results 
would not be pretty.  
Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
16  
There are four primary feature types:  
• Extrude  
• Revolve  
• Sweep  
• Loft 
 
For an Extrude, you place a sketch and then add height or thickness.  Common objects 
that use extrudes are boxes.  
 
For a Revolve, you place a sketch and then revolve it around an axis.  An axis can be an edge or 
line.   
Common objects that use revolves are wheels and gears.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
17  
For a Sweep, you create two sketches.  One sketch is the profile and one sketch is the path.  The 
profile travels along the path to create the 3D shape. The two sketches are usually 
perpendicular to each other.  The path would be on one plane, and the profile would be on a 
different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

1 Getting Started  
Explanation of how Onshape Works  
When I started working in CAD in 1982, the emerging software – the new kid on the block – was 
AutoCAD created by a company headquartered  in San Rafael, California named Autodesk.  The 
interface consisted of a screen menu.  You used a keyboard and short cut keys – like L for Line – 
to create your technical drawings, which consisted of lines, arcs, and circles.  There was no 
rendering.  Ther e were no layers.  There was no color.  You drew in white on a black 
background.  At the time, many drafters and designers said that CADD (Computer Aided 
Drafting/Design) software would never replace pencil and paper.  
So, here we are in 2016  and how the wo rld has changed.  Today most CADD software is moving 
to the cloud.  This means that users will download a small software program that allows them to log in to an account and save their work on remote servers.  So, users are no longer tied down to a worksta tion or an office.  You can access your work from any device anywhere in the world 
– as long as you have an internet connection.  
Onshape takes it one step beyond this.   
Firstly, Onshape is entire ly 100% cloud -based.  This means you don’t have to install a ny 
software.  You don’t have to get permission from your IT department to put the software on your workstation , and you don’t use up any space on your hard drive or jump drive or wherever 
you like to store files.  Everything happens on Onshape’ s servers.   
Because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, it is accessible from any device that uses a browser, 
like Firefox or Chrome.  This means that you can pull up Onshape with any internet connection on your tablet, smart phone, laptop, or work station.  Onshape even  offers apps for Android and 
iOS devices.  
Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.   
Onshape does use “cookies,”  so make sure you set your browser to accept cookies.  If th e 
browser interface is not working properly, perform a hard refresh. (H old down Command and 
Shift, then press R in any Apple or Mac operating system.  For a WINDOWS operating system, press Ctl+F5. )  GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

4 8. You start in the Tutorials and Samples area.  
 
Onshape has two document states:  Public and Private.  If a document is public, anybody with an 
Onshape account can view and download the file.   If you a re the owner or creator of the 
document, you can share it with other users, but the users must have an Onshape account.   
Both public and private documents can be shared.  Sharing a document allows anyone who has 
been provided access to make modifications to the document.  More than one user can edit a 
shared document at a time, similarly to how Google Docs works.   
If you are not the owner/creator of a document, you cannot  share it.  I f you find a public model 
that you like, you can send the URL t o a friend, so they can see it .  Since neither you nor  your 
friend own the model, neither you nor  your friend w ill be able to modify the file.   Alternatively, 
you can make a copy of a public document and own the copy.  Once you own the copy, you can share it w ith anyone you like.  
You can transfer ownership of a document to another user. If you are finished working on a project, you can hand it off to another user and let them take over.

If you want to transfer ownership to another user, select Owner from the drop -down list.  Then 
left click on the Share button.   
For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.  
There is a tutorial that walks you through how to create the stl file once you are satisfied with 
your design.  
When you first create a document, there are three planes in the display window.  The planes are 
named Front, Top, and Right.  These correspond with the front, top, and right views in a 2D drawing.  
The planes are displayed as thin rectangles.  Planes are infinite, but there really isn’t a good way to display an infinite plane.  Think of the plane as a limitless piece of paper.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
15  
In the browser, under Default geometry, the Origin and the three planes are listed.  
 
The origin is the 0,0,0 (x =0, y=0, z=0) point in the 3D universe where you are creating the 
design.  
The origin basically allows you to locate the geometry in relation to 3 -dimensional space.  If you 
don’t provide a location for the lines, circles, and arcs, it could move around and the results 
would not be pretty.  
Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
16  
There are four primary feature types:  
• Extrude  
• Revolve  
• Sweep  
• Loft 
 
For an Extrude, you place a sketch and then add height or thickness.  Common objects 
that use extrudes are boxes.  
 
For a Revolve, you place a sketch and then revolve it around an axis.  An axis can be an edge or 
line.   
Common objects that use revolves are wheels and gears.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
17  
For a Sweep, you create two sketches.  One sketch is the profile and one sketch is the path.  The 
profile travels along the path to create the 3D shape. The two sketches are usually 
perpendicular to each other.  The path would be on one plane, and the profile would be on a 
different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

1 Getting Started  
Explanation of how Onshape Works  
When I started working in CAD in 1982, the emerging software – the new kid on the block – was 
AutoCAD created by a company headquartered  in San Rafael, California named Autodesk.  The 
interface consisted of a screen menu.  You used a keyboard and short cut keys – like L for Line – 
to create your technical drawings, which consisted of lines, arcs, and circles.  There was no 
rendering.  Ther e were no layers.  There was no color.  You drew in white on a black 
background.  At the time, many drafters and designers said that CADD (Computer Aided 
Drafting/Design) software would never replace pencil and paper.  
So, here we are in 2016  and how the wo rld has changed.  Today most CADD software is moving 
to the cloud.  This means that users will download a small software program that allows them to log in to an account and save their work on remote servers.  So, users are no longer tied down to a worksta tion or an office.  You can access your work from any device anywhere in the world 
– as long as you have an internet connection.  
Onshape takes it one step beyond this.   
Firstly, Onshape is entire ly 100% cloud -based.  This means you don’t have to install a ny 
software.  You don’t have to get permission from your IT department to put the software on your workstation , and you don’t use up any space on your hard drive or jump drive or wherever 
you like to store files.  Everything happens on Onshape’ s servers.   
Because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, it is accessible from any device that uses a browser, 
like Firefox or Chrome.  This means that you can pull up Onshape with any internet connection on your tablet, smart phone, laptop, or work station.  Onshape even  offers apps for Android and 
iOS devices.  
Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.   
Onshape does use “cookies,”  so make sure you set your browser to accept cookies.  If th e 
browser interface is not working properly, perform a hard refresh. (H old down Command and 
Shift, then press R in any Apple or Mac operating system.  For a WINDOWS operating system, press Ctl+F5. )  GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

Onshape has two document states:  Public and Private.  If a document is public, anybody with an 
Onshape account can view and download the file.   If you a re the owner or creator of the 
document, you can share it with other users, but the users must have an Onshape account.   
Both public and private documents can be shared.  Sharing a document allows anyone who has 
been provided access to make modifications to the document.  More than one user can edit a 
shared document at a time, similarly to how Google Docs works.   
If you are not the owner/creator of a document, you cannot  share it.  I f you find a public model 
that you like, you can send the URL t o a friend, so they can see it .  Since neither you nor  your 
friend own the model, neither you nor  your friend w ill be able to modify the file.   Alternatively, 
you can make a copy of a public document and own the copy.  Once you own the copy, you can share it w ith anyone you like.  
You can transfer ownership of a document to another user. If you are finished working on a project, you can hand it off to another user and let them take over.

document, you can share it with other users, but the users must have an Onshape account.   
Both public and private documents can be shared.  Sharing a document allows anyone who has 
been provided access to make modifications to the document.  More than one user can edit a 
shared document at a time, similarly to how Google Docs works.   
If you are not the owner/creator of a document, you cannot  share it.  I f you find a public model 
that you like, you can send the URL t o a friend, so they can see it .  Since neither you nor  your 
friend own the model, neither you nor  your friend w ill be able to modify the file.   Alternatively, 
you can make a copy of a public document and own the copy.  Once you own the copy, you can share it w ith anyone you like.  
You can transfer ownership of a document to another user. If you are finished working on a project, you can hand it off to another user and let them take over.

If you want to transfer ownership to another user, select Owner from the drop -down list.  Then 
left click on the Share button.   
For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.  
There is a tutorial that walks you through how to create the stl file once you are satisfied with 
your design.  
When you first create a document, there are three planes in the display window.  The planes are 
named Front, Top, and Right.  These correspond with the front, top, and right views in a 2D drawing.  
The planes are displayed as thin rectangles.  Planes are infinite, but there really isn’t a good way to display an infinite plane.  Think of the plane as a limitless piece of paper.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
15  
In the browser, under Default geometry, the Origin and the three planes are listed.  
 
The origin is the 0,0,0 (x =0, y=0, z=0) point in the 3D universe where you are creating the 
design.  
The origin basically allows you to locate the geometry in relation to 3 -dimensional space.  If you 
don’t provide a location for the lines, circles, and arcs, it could move around and the results 
would not be pretty.  
Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
16  
There are four primary feature types:  
• Extrude  
• Revolve  
• Sweep  
• Loft 
 
For an Extrude, you place a sketch and then add height or thickness.  Common objects 
that use extrudes are boxes.  
 
For a Revolve, you place a sketch and then revolve it around an axis.  An axis can be an edge or 
line.   
Common objects that use revolves are wheels and gears.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
17  
For a Sweep, you create two sketches.  One sketch is the profile and one sketch is the path.  The 
profile travels along the path to create the 3D shape. The two sketches are usually 
perpendicular to each other.  The path would be on one plane, and the profile would be on a 
different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

1 Getting Started  
Explanation of how Onshape Works  
When I started working in CAD in 1982, the emerging software – the new kid on the block – was 
AutoCAD created by a company headquartered  in San Rafael, California named Autodesk.  The 
interface consisted of a screen menu.  You used a keyboard and short cut keys – like L for Line – 
to create your technical drawings, which consisted of lines, arcs, and circles.  There was no 
rendering.  Ther e were no layers.  There was no color.  You drew in white on a black 
background.  At the time, many drafters and designers said that CADD (Computer Aided 
Drafting/Design) software would never replace pencil and paper.  
So, here we are in 2016  and how the wo rld has changed.  Today most CADD software is moving 
to the cloud.  This means that users will download a small software program that allows them to log in to an account and save their work on remote servers.  So, users are no longer tied down to a worksta tion or an office.  You can access your work from any device anywhere in the world 
– as long as you have an internet connection.  
Onshape takes it one step beyond this.   
Firstly, Onshape is entire ly 100% cloud -based.  This means you don’t have to install a ny 
software.  You don’t have to get permission from your IT department to put the software on your workstation , and you don’t use up any space on your hard drive or jump drive or wherever 
you like to store files.  Everything happens on Onshape’ s servers.   
Because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, it is accessible from any device that uses a browser, 
like Firefox or Chrome.  This means that you can pull up Onshape with any internet connection on your tablet, smart phone, laptop, or work station.  Onshape even  offers apps for Android and 
iOS devices.  
Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.   
Onshape does use “cookies,”  so make sure you set your browser to accept cookies.  If th e 
browser interface is not working properly, perform a hard refresh. (H old down Command and 
Shift, then press R in any Apple or Mac operating system.  For a WINDOWS operating system, press Ctl+F5. )  GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.   
Onshape does use “cookies,”  so make sure you set your browser to accept cookies.  If th e 
browser interface is not working properly, perform a hard refresh. (H old down Command and 
Shift, then press R in any Apple or Mac operating system.  For a WINDOWS operating system, press Ctl+F5. )  GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

Onshape has two document states:  Public and Private.  If a document is public, anybody with an 
Onshape account can view and download the file.   If you a re the owner or creator of the 
document, you can share it with other users, but the users must have an Onshape account.   
Both public and private documents can be shared.  Sharing a document allows anyone who has 
been provided access to make modifications to the document.  More than one user can edit a 
shared document at a time, similarly to how Google Docs works.   
If you are not the owner/creator of a document, you cannot  share it.  I f you find a public model 
that you like, you can send the URL t o a friend, so they can see it .  Since neither you nor  your 
friend own the model, neither you nor  your friend w ill be able to modify the file.   Alternatively, 
you can make a copy of a public document and own the copy.  Once you own the copy, you can share it w ith anyone you like.  
You can transfer ownership of a document to another user. If you are finished working on a project, you can hand it off to another user and let them take over.

For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.  
There is a tutorial that walks you through how to create the stl file once you are satisfied with 
your design.  
When you first create a document, there are three planes in the display window.  The planes are 
named Front, Top, and Right.  These correspond with the front, top, and right views in a 2D drawing.  
The planes are displayed as thin rectangles.  Planes are infinite, but there really isn’t a good way to display an infinite plane.  Think of the plane as a limitless piece of paper.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
15  
In the browser, under Default geometry, the Origin and the three planes are listed.  
 
The origin is the 0,0,0 (x =0, y=0, z=0) point in the 3D universe where you are creating the 
design.  
The origin basically allows you to locate the geometry in relation to 3 -dimensional space.  If you 
don’t provide a location for the lines, circles, and arcs, it could move around and the results 
would not be pretty.  
Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
16  
There are four primary feature types:  
• Extrude  
• Revolve  
• Sweep  
• Loft 
 
For an Extrude, you place a sketch and then add height or thickness.  Common objects 
that use extrudes are boxes.  
 
For a Revolve, you place a sketch and then revolve it around an axis.  An axis can be an edge or 
line.   
Common objects that use revolves are wheels and gears.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
17  
For a Sweep, you create two sketches.  One sketch is the profile and one sketch is the path.  The 
profile travels along the path to create the 3D shape. The two sketches are usually 
perpendicular to each other.  The path would be on one plane, and the profile would be on a 
different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

1 Getting Started  
Explanation of how Onshape Works  
When I started working in CAD in 1982, the emerging software – the new kid on the block – was 
AutoCAD created by a company headquartered  in San Rafael, California named Autodesk.  The 
interface consisted of a screen menu.  You used a keyboard and short cut keys – like L for Line – 
to create your technical drawings, which consisted of lines, arcs, and circles.  There was no 
rendering.  Ther e were no layers.  There was no color.  You drew in white on a black 
background.  At the time, many drafters and designers said that CADD (Computer Aided 
Drafting/Design) software would never replace pencil and paper.  
So, here we are in 2016  and how the wo rld has changed.  Today most CADD software is moving 
to the cloud.  This means that users will download a small software program that allows them to log in to an account and save their work on remote servers.  So, users are no longer tied down to a worksta tion or an office.  You can access your work from any device anywhere in the world 
– as long as you have an internet connection.  
Onshape takes it one step beyond this.   
Firstly, Onshape is entire ly 100% cloud -based.  This means you don’t have to install a ny 
software.  You don’t have to get permission from your IT department to put the software on your workstation , and you don’t use up any space on your hard drive or jump drive or wherever 
you like to store files.  Everything happens on Onshape’ s servers.   
Because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, it is accessible from any device that uses a browser, 
like Firefox or Chrome.  This means that you can pull up Onshape with any internet connection on your tablet, smart phone, laptop, or work station.  Onshape even  offers apps for Android and 
iOS devices.  
Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.   
Onshape does use “cookies,”  so make sure you set your browser to accept cookies.  If th e 
browser interface is not working properly, perform a hard refresh. (H old down Command and 
Shift, then press R in any Apple or Mac operating system.  For a WINDOWS operating system, press Ctl+F5. )  GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or

1 Getting Started  
Explanation of how Onshape Works  
When I started working in CAD in 1982, the emerging software – the new kid on the block – was 
AutoCAD created by a company headquartered  in San Rafael, California named Autodesk.  The 
interface consisted of a screen menu.  You used a keyboard and short cut keys – like L for Line – 
to create your technical drawings, which consisted of lines, arcs, and circles.  There was no 
rendering.  Ther e were no layers.  There was no color.  You drew in white on a black 
background.  At the time, many drafters and designers said that CADD (Computer Aided 
Drafting/Design) software would never replace pencil and paper.  
So, here we are in 2016  and how the wo rld has changed.  Today most CADD software is moving 
to the cloud.  This means that users will download a small software program that allows them to log in to an account and save their work on remote servers.  So, users are no longer tied down to a worksta tion or an office.  You can access your work from any device anywhere in the world 
– as long as you have an internet connection.  
Onshape takes it one step beyond this.   
Firstly, Onshape is entire ly 100% cloud -based.  This means you don’t have to install a ny 
software.  You don’t have to get permission from your IT department to put the software on your workstation , and you don’t use up any space on your hard drive or jump drive or wherever 
you like to store files.  Everything happens on Onshape’ s servers.   
Because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, it is accessible from any device that uses a browser, 
like Firefox or Chrome.  This means that you can pull up Onshape with any internet connection on your tablet, smart phone, laptop, or work station.  Onshape even  offers apps for Android and 
iOS devices.  
Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.   
Onshape does use “cookies,”  so make sure you set your browser to accept cookies.  If th e 
browser interface is not working properly, perform a hard refresh. (H old down Command and 
Shift, then press R in any Apple or Mac operating system.  For a WINDOWS operating system, press Ctl+F5. )  GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

added Onshape to your contacts list.  
 
6. Select the link  that is provided in the email . 
 
7. Set up a password for the account. Be sure to write it down somewhere! Press the Sign Up button and Onshape will immediately launch.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
4 8. You start in the Tutorials and Samples area.  
 
Onshape has two document states:  Public and Private.  If a document is public, anybody with an 
Onshape account can view and download the file.   If you a re the owner or creator of the 
document, you can share it with other users, but the users must have an Onshape account.   
Both public and private documents can be shared.  Sharing a document allows anyone who has 
been provided access to make modifications to the document.  More than one user can edit a 
shared document at a time, similarly to how Google Docs works.   
If you are not the owner/creator of a document, you cannot  share it.  I f you find a public model 
that you like, you can send the URL t o a friend, so they can see it .  Since neither you nor  your 
friend own the model, neither you nor  your friend w ill be able to modify the file.   Alternatively, 
you can make a copy of a public document and own the copy.  Once you own the copy, you can share it w ith anyone you like.  
You can transfer ownership of a document to another user. If you are finished working on a project, you can hand it off to another user and let them take over.

If you want to transfer ownership to another user, select Owner from the drop -down list.  Then 
left click on the Share button.   
For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.  
There is a tutorial that walks you through how to create the stl file once you are satisfied with 
your design.  
When you first create a document, there are three planes in the display window.  The planes are 
named Front, Top, and Right.  These correspond with the front, top, and right views in a 2D drawing.  
The planes are displayed as thin rectangles.  Planes are infinite, but there really isn’t a good way to display an infinite plane.  Think of the plane as a limitless piece of paper.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
15  
In the browser, under Default geometry, the Origin and the three planes are listed.  
 
The origin is the 0,0,0 (x =0, y=0, z=0) point in the 3D universe where you are creating the 
design.  
The origin basically allows you to locate the geometry in relation to 3 -dimensional space.  If you 
don’t provide a location for the lines, circles, and arcs, it could move around and the results 
would not be pretty.  
Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
16  
There are four primary feature types:  
• Extrude  
• Revolve  
• Sweep  
• Loft 
 
For an Extrude, you place a sketch and then add height or thickness.  Common objects 
that use extrudes are boxes.  
 
For a Revolve, you place a sketch and then revolve it around an axis.  An axis can be an edge or 
line.   
Common objects that use revolves are wheels and gears.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
17  
For a Sweep, you create two sketches.  One sketch is the profile and one sketch is the path.  The 
profile travels along the path to create the 3D shape. The two sketches are usually 
perpendicular to each other.  The path would be on one plane, and the profile would be on a 
different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

1 Getting Started  
Explanation of how Onshape Works  
When I started working in CAD in 1982, the emerging software – the new kid on the block – was 
AutoCAD created by a company headquartered  in San Rafael, California named Autodesk.  The 
interface consisted of a screen menu.  You used a keyboard and short cut keys – like L for Line – 
to create your technical drawings, which consisted of lines, arcs, and circles.  There was no 
rendering.  Ther e were no layers.  There was no color.  You drew in white on a black 
background.  At the time, many drafters and designers said that CADD (Computer Aided 
Drafting/Design) software would never replace pencil and paper.  
So, here we are in 2016  and how the wo rld has changed.  Today most CADD software is moving 
to the cloud.  This means that users will download a small software program that allows them to log in to an account and save their work on remote servers.  So, users are no longer tied down to a worksta tion or an office.  You can access your work from any device anywhere in the world 
– as long as you have an internet connection.  
Onshape takes it one step beyond this.   
Firstly, Onshape is entire ly 100% cloud -based.  This means you don’t have to install a ny 
software.  You don’t have to get permission from your IT department to put the software on your workstation , and you don’t use up any space on your hard drive or jump drive or wherever 
you like to store files.  Everything happens on Onshape’ s servers.   
Because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, it is accessible from any device that uses a browser, 
like Firefox or Chrome.  This means that you can pull up Onshape with any internet connection on your tablet, smart phone, laptop, or work station.  Onshape even  offers apps for Android and 
iOS devices.  
Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.   
Onshape does use “cookies,”  so make sure you set your browser to accept cookies.  If th e 
browser interface is not working properly, perform a hard refresh. (H old down Command and 
Shift, then press R in any Apple or Mac operating system.  For a WINDOWS operating system, press Ctl+F5. )  GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

4 8. You start in the Tutorials and Samples area.  
 
Onshape has two document states:  Public and Private.  If a document is public, anybody with an 
Onshape account can view and download the file.   If you a re the owner or creator of the 
document, you can share it with other users, but the users must have an Onshape account.   
Both public and private documents can be shared.  Sharing a document allows anyone who has 
been provided access to make modifications to the document.  More than one user can edit a 
shared document at a time, similarly to how Google Docs works.   
If you are not the owner/creator of a document, you cannot  share it.  I f you find a public model 
that you like, you can send the URL t o a friend, so they can see it .  Since neither you nor  your 
friend own the model, neither you nor  your friend w ill be able to modify the file.   Alternatively, 
you can make a copy of a public document and own the copy.  Once you own the copy, you can share it w ith anyone you like.  
You can transfer ownership of a document to another user. If you are finished working on a project, you can hand it off to another user and let them take over.

Estimated Time:  5 minutes  
Objectives:   
• Collaboration  
 
1. Login to Onshape. Locate the Wind Meter which was copied to the My Documents area. 
Left click to open  the document.  
 
2. Left click on the Share button.

wish to share the document. Anybody you share a document with is called a 
Collaborator. Press Share.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
14 4. The Collaborator’s  email is now listed. Press Close . 
 
 
If you want to transfer ownership to another user, select Owner from the drop -down list.  Then 
left click on the Share button.   
For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.  
There is a tutorial that walks you through how to create the stl file once you are satisfied with 
your design.  
When you first create a document, there are three planes in the display window.  The planes are 
named Front, Top, and Right.  These correspond with the front, top, and right views in a 2D drawing.  
The planes are displayed as thin rectangles.  Planes are infinite, but there really isn’t a good way to display an infinite plane.  Think of the plane as a limitless piece of paper.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
15  
In the browser, under Default geometry, the Origin and the three planes are listed.  
 
The origin is the 0,0,0 (x =0, y=0, z=0) point in the 3D universe where you are creating the 
design.  
The origin basically allows you to locate the geometry in relation to 3 -dimensional space.  If you 
don’t provide a location for the lines, circles, and arcs, it could move around and the results 
would not be pretty.  
Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
16  
There are four primary feature types:  
• Extrude  
• Revolve  
• Sweep  
• Loft 
 
For an Extrude, you place a sketch and then add height or thickness.  Common objects 
that use extrudes are boxes.  
 
For a Revolve, you place a sketch and then revolve it around an axis.  An axis can be an edge or 
line.   
Common objects that use revolves are wheels and gears.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
17  
For a Sweep, you create two sketches.  One sketch is the profile and one sketch is the path.  The 
profile travels along the path to create the 3D shape. The two sketches are usually 
perpendicular to each other.  The path would be on one plane, and the profile would be on a 
different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.

19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated

you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.  
There is a tutorial that walks you through how to create the stl file once you are satisfied with 
your design.  
When you first create a document, there are three planes in the display window.  The planes are 
named Front, Top, and Right.  These correspond with the front, top, and right views in a 2D drawing.  
The planes are displayed as thin rectangles.  Planes are infinite, but there really isn’t a good way to display an infinite plane.  Think of the plane as a limitless piece of paper.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
15  
In the browser, under Default geometry, the Origin and the three planes are listed.  
 
The origin is the 0,0,0 (x =0, y=0, z=0) point in the 3D universe where you are creating the 
design.  
The origin basically allows you to locate the geometry in relation to 3 -dimensional space.  If you 
don’t provide a location for the lines, circles, and arcs, it could move around and the results 
would not be pretty.  
Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
16  
There are four primary feature types:  
• Extrude  
• Revolve  
• Sweep  
• Loft 
 
For an Extrude, you place a sketch and then add height or thickness.  Common objects 
that use extrudes are boxes.  
 
For a Revolve, you place a sketch and then revolve it around an axis.  An axis can be an edge or 
line.   
Common objects that use revolves are wheels and gears.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
17  
For a Sweep, you create two sketches.  One sketch is the profile and one sketch is the path.  The 
profile travels along the path to create the 3D shape. The two sketches are usually 
perpendicular to each other.  The path would be on one plane, and the profile would be on a 
different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

1 Getting Started  
Explanation of how Onshape Works  
When I started working in CAD in 1982, the emerging software – the new kid on the block – was 
AutoCAD created by a company headquartered  in San Rafael, California named Autodesk.  The 
interface consisted of a screen menu.  You used a keyboard and short cut keys – like L for Line – 
to create your technical drawings, which consisted of lines, arcs, and circles.  There was no 
rendering.  Ther e were no layers.  There was no color.  You drew in white on a black 
background.  At the time, many drafters and designers said that CADD (Computer Aided 
Drafting/Design) software would never replace pencil and paper.  
So, here we are in 2016  and how the wo rld has changed.  Today most CADD software is moving 
to the cloud.  This means that users will download a small software program that allows them to log in to an account and save their work on remote servers.  So, users are no longer tied down to a worksta tion or an office.  You can access your work from any device anywhere in the world 
– as long as you have an internet connection.  
Onshape takes it one step beyond this.   
Firstly, Onshape is entire ly 100% cloud -based.  This means you don’t have to install a ny 
software.  You don’t have to get permission from your IT department to put the software on your workstation , and you don’t use up any space on your hard drive or jump drive or wherever 
you like to store files.  Everything happens on Onshape’ s servers.   
Because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, it is accessible from any device that uses a browser, 
like Firefox or Chrome.  This means that you can pull up Onshape with any internet connection on your tablet, smart phone, laptop, or work station.  Onshape even  offers apps for Android and 
iOS devices.  
Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.   
Onshape does use “cookies,”  so make sure you set your browser to accept cookies.  If th e 
browser interface is not working properly, perform a hard refresh. (H old down Command and 
Shift, then press R in any Apple or Mac operating system.  For a WINDOWS operating system, press Ctl+F5. )  GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

7. Set up a password for the account. Be sure to write it down somewhere! Press the Sign Up button and Onshape will immediately launch.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
4 8. You start in the Tutorials and Samples area.  
 
Onshape has two document states:  Public and Private.  If a document is public, anybody with an 
Onshape account can view and download the file.   If you a re the owner or creator of the 
document, you can share it with other users, but the users must have an Onshape account.   
Both public and private documents can be shared.  Sharing a document allows anyone who has 
been provided access to make modifications to the document.  More than one user can edit a 
shared document at a time, similarly to how Google Docs works.   
If you are not the owner/creator of a document, you cannot  share it.  I f you find a public model 
that you like, you can send the URL t o a friend, so they can see it .  Since neither you nor  your 
friend own the model, neither you nor  your friend w ill be able to modify the file.   Alternatively, 
you can make a copy of a public document and own the copy.  Once you own the copy, you can share it w ith anyone you like.  
You can transfer ownership of a document to another user. If you are finished working on a project, you can hand it off to another user and let them take over.

For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.

For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.  
There is a tutorial that walks you through how to create the stl file once you are satisfied with 
your design.  
When you first create a document, there are three planes in the display window.  The planes are 
named Front, Top, and Right.  These correspond with the front, top, and right views in a 2D drawing.  
The planes are displayed as thin rectangles.  Planes are infinite, but there really isn’t a good way to display an infinite plane.  Think of the plane as a limitless piece of paper.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
15  
In the browser, under Default geometry, the Origin and the three planes are listed.  
 
The origin is the 0,0,0 (x =0, y=0, z=0) point in the 3D universe where you are creating the 
design.  
The origin basically allows you to locate the geometry in relation to 3 -dimensional space.  If you 
don’t provide a location for the lines, circles, and arcs, it could move around and the results 
would not be pretty.  
Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
16  
There are four primary feature types:  
• Extrude  
• Revolve  
• Sweep  
• Loft 
 
For an Extrude, you place a sketch and then add height or thickness.  Common objects 
that use extrudes are boxes.  
 
For a Revolve, you place a sketch and then revolve it around an axis.  An axis can be an edge or 
line.   
Common objects that use revolves are wheels and gears.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
17  
For a Sweep, you create two sketches.  One sketch is the profile and one sketch is the path.  The 
profile travels along the path to create the 3D shape. The two sketches are usually 
perpendicular to each other.  The path would be on one plane, and the profile would be on a 
different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

1 Getting Started  
Explanation of how Onshape Works  
When I started working in CAD in 1982, the emerging software – the new kid on the block – was 
AutoCAD created by a company headquartered  in San Rafael, California named Autodesk.  The 
interface consisted of a screen menu.  You used a keyboard and short cut keys – like L for Line – 
to create your technical drawings, which consisted of lines, arcs, and circles.  There was no 
rendering.  Ther e were no layers.  There was no color.  You drew in white on a black 
background.  At the time, many drafters and designers said that CADD (Computer Aided 
Drafting/Design) software would never replace pencil and paper.  
So, here we are in 2016  and how the wo rld has changed.  Today most CADD software is moving 
to the cloud.  This means that users will download a small software program that allows them to log in to an account and save their work on remote servers.  So, users are no longer tied down to a worksta tion or an office.  You can access your work from any device anywhere in the world 
– as long as you have an internet connection.  
Onshape takes it one step beyond this.   
Firstly, Onshape is entire ly 100% cloud -based.  This means you don’t have to install a ny 
software.  You don’t have to get permission from your IT department to put the software on your workstation , and you don’t use up any space on your hard drive or jump drive or wherever 
you like to store files.  Everything happens on Onshape’ s servers.   
Because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, it is accessible from any device that uses a browser, 
like Firefox or Chrome.  This means that you can pull up Onshape with any internet connection on your tablet, smart phone, laptop, or work station.  Onshape even  offers apps for Android and 
iOS devices.  
Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.   
Onshape does use “cookies,”  so make sure you set your browser to accept cookies.  If th e 
browser interface is not working properly, perform a hard refresh. (H old down Command and 
Shift, then press R in any Apple or Mac operating system.  For a WINDOWS operating system, press Ctl+F5. )  GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

4 8. You start in the Tutorials and Samples area.  
 
Onshape has two document states:  Public and Private.  If a document is public, anybody with an 
Onshape account can view and download the file.   If you a re the owner or creator of the 
document, you can share it with other users, but the users must have an Onshape account.   
Both public and private documents can be shared.  Sharing a document allows anyone who has 
been provided access to make modifications to the document.  More than one user can edit a 
shared document at a time, similarly to how Google Docs works.   
If you are not the owner/creator of a document, you cannot  share it.  I f you find a public model 
that you like, you can send the URL t o a friend, so they can see it .  Since neither you nor  your 
friend own the model, neither you nor  your friend w ill be able to modify the file.   Alternatively, 
you can make a copy of a public document and own the copy.  Once you own the copy, you can share it w ith anyone you like.  
You can transfer ownership of a document to another user. If you are finished working on a project, you can hand it off to another user and let them take over.

For the first project, we will design a custom signet ring that can be rapid prototyped.  Many 
schools have their own 3D printers.  If you do not have access to a 3D printer at your school or 
office, you can download your model file in an stl format onto a jump drive and take it t o your 
local office supply store, such as Staples or Office Depot.  These stores have 3D printers available and can print your model for a small charge.  
There is a tutorial that walks you through how to create the stl file once you are satisfied with 
your design.  
When you first create a document, there are three planes in the display window.  The planes are 
named Front, Top, and Right.  These correspond with the front, top, and right views in a 2D drawing.  
The planes are displayed as thin rectangles.  Planes are infinite, but there really isn’t a good way to display an infinite plane.  Think of the plane as a limitless piece of paper.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
15  
In the browser, under Default geometry, the Origin and the three planes are listed.  
 
The origin is the 0,0,0 (x =0, y=0, z=0) point in the 3D universe where you are creating the 
design.  
The origin basically allows you to locate the geometry in relation to 3 -dimensional space.  If you 
don’t provide a location for the lines, circles, and arcs, it could move around and the results 
would not be pretty.  
Each part is created by drawing a sketch on a plane, then creating a feature from the sketch, and then adding on.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
16  
There are four primary feature types:  
• Extrude  
• Revolve  
• Sweep  
• Loft 
 
For an Extrude, you place a sketch and then add height or thickness.  Common objects 
that use extrudes are boxes.  
 
For a Revolve, you place a sketch and then revolve it around an axis.  An axis can be an edge or 
line.   
Common objects that use revolves are wheels and gears.  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
17  
For a Sweep, you create two sketches.  One sketch is the profile and one sketch is the path.  The 
profile travels along the path to create the 3D shape. The two sketches are usually 
perpendicular to each other.  The path would be on one plane, and the profile would be on a 
different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.  
 
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
18 Geometric constraints are located on the sketch ribbon.  To add a sketch constraint to 
geometry, select the element(s) and then select the desired constraint.  
Sketches can be under -defined, fully -defined, or over -defined.  Under -defined means the sketch 
does not have all the information – dimensions or geometric constraints – to fully constrain or 
define all the elements.  Fully defined means that all the geometry has been fully designated.  
Over -defined means  that there is duplicate information in the sketch.  
When a sketch element is displayed in blue that indicates it is not fully defined.  When a sketch 
element is defined in black, it is fully defined.  
 
Because the sketch is located in 3 -dimensional space, the elements always need to be located in 
relation to the origin in order to be fully defined.  Otherwise, they are just floating in space.  
As dimensions and geometric constraints are placed, the geometry changes color.  
Black represents geometry that is fu lly defined and blue indicates geometry that is under 
defined.  
Some of the elements in this sketch are displayed as blue because it still isn’t indicated where it is located in relation to the origin.  
 
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
19 Once the two dimensions are added to indicate where t he elements are located relative to the 
origin, the sketch will display in black – fully defined.  
 
The browser keeps track of the sketches and features as they are placed.  You can go back and 
modify sketches and features at any time.  Sketches can be moved  to a different plane, if desired 
as well.  
 
The Onshape document consists of multiple tabs.  
 
Right now there are three types of tabs that can be generated:  
• Part Studio – where parts are defined  
• Assembly – where parts are assembled  
• Drawing – 2D drawings t o be annotated  
  
GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE   
20 There is no limit to the number of tabs in any single document.  So, even with a free account, 
you could use a single document to store all your parts and not exceed the document limits of a free account.

1 Getting Started  
Explanation of how Onshape Works  
When I started working in CAD in 1982, the emerging software – the new kid on the block – was 
AutoCAD created by a company headquartered  in San Rafael, California named Autodesk.  The 
interface consisted of a screen menu.  You used a keyboard and short cut keys – like L for Line – 
to create your technical drawings, which consisted of lines, arcs, and circles.  There was no 
rendering.  Ther e were no layers.  There was no color.  You drew in white on a black 
background.  At the time, many drafters and designers said that CADD (Computer Aided 
Drafting/Design) software would never replace pencil and paper.  
So, here we are in 2016  and how the wo rld has changed.  Today most CADD software is moving 
to the cloud.  This means that users will download a small software program that allows them to log in to an account and save their work on remote servers.  So, users are no longer tied down to a worksta tion or an office.  You can access your work from any device anywhere in the world 
– as long as you have an internet connection.  
Onshape takes it one step beyond this.   
Firstly, Onshape is entire ly 100% cloud -based.  This means you don’t have to install a ny 
software.  You don’t have to get permission from your IT department to put the software on your workstation , and you don’t use up any space on your hard drive or jump drive or wherever 
you like to store files.  Everything happens on Onshape’ s servers.   
Because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, it is accessible from any device that uses a browser, 
like Firefox or Chrome.  This means that you can pull up Onshape with any internet connection on your tablet, smart phone, laptop, or work station.  Onshape even  offers apps for Android and 
iOS devices.  
Secondly, Onshape offers a free  version to users.  The free version is perfect for students and 
hobbyists.  You can open an account without a credit card using an email address.  The free account limits the amount  of space you are provided, but you can always delete a project to free 
up space and start over.  
Thirdly, because Onshape is entirely cloud -based, you are always using the latest version of 
Onshape.  Onshape is regularly updated to  fix bugs and add new features.  Because Onshape is 
constantly being updated some of the screenshots you see in this text may look different fr om 
what you see on your screen.   Try to ignore any differences.  The tools should work the same 
way even if new features have been adde d. 
Onshape works best using Chrome or Firefox browsers.  It will not work at all with Internet Explorer.  Onshape requires WebGL, which IE does not currently support.   
Onshape does use “cookies,”  so make sure you set your browser to accept cookies.  If th e 
browser interface is not working properly, perform a hard refresh. (H old down Command and 
Shift, then press R in any Apple or Mac operating system.  For a WINDOWS operating system, press Ctl+F5. )  GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

Onshape has two document states:  Public and Private.  If a document is public, anybody with an 
Onshape account can view and download the file.   If you a re the owner or creator of the 
document, you can share it with other users, but the users must have an Onshape account.   
Both public and private documents can be shared.  Sharing a document allows anyone who has 
been provided access to make modifications to the document.  More than one user can edit a 
shared document at a time, similarly to how Google Docs works.   
If you are not the owner/creator of a document, you cannot  share it.  I f you find a public model 
that you like, you can send the URL t o a friend, so they can see it .  Since neither you nor  your 
friend own the model, neither you nor  your friend w ill be able to modify the file.   Alternatively, 
you can make a copy of a public document and own the copy.  Once you own the copy, you can share it w ith anyone you like.  
You can transfer ownership of a document to another user. If you are finished working on a project, you can hand it off to another user and let them take over.
