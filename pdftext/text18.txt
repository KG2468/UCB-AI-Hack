GETTING STARTED WITH  ONSHAPE

For a Sweep, you create two sketches.  One sketch is the profile and one sketch is the path.  The 
profile travels along the path to create the 3D shape. The two sketches are usually 
perpendicular to each other.  The path would be on one plane, and the profile would be on a 
different plane.  
Common objects that use sweeps are handles, ducts, and cords.  
 
A Loft is also called a blend.  A loft is created by placing two or more sketches on offset planes.  Each sketch is usually a diffe rent shape. The loft blends the sketches together to create a unique 
3D feature. Common objects that use lofts are faucets and bottles.  
 
When you model a part, you usually create more than one feature.  A part might include an extrude, a revolve, and a loft or it  might just be a single sweep.  It depends on how complicated 
the part is.  As you work through this text, some parts will be fairly simple and other parts will be quite complex.  
When you create a sketch, you draw the geometry – lines, arcs, and circles.  Then you use sketch 
constraints to determine how the elements interact.  There are two types of sketch constraints – 
geometric and dimensional.  Geometric constraints are horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, concentric, coincident, tangent, equal, midpoint, symmetric, etc.
