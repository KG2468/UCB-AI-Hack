'This image shows a 3D navigation cube typically used in computer-aided design (CAD) software. The cube illustrates the orientation of the 3D model, with labeled sides such as "Front," "Right," and "Top." The X, Y, and Z axes are also indicated, showing the spatial orientation of the model in the 3D space. There are arrows around the cube suggesting the ability to rotate the view.'
